Slight changes: I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix, with 1/2 cup veg. oil and 1/3 cup milk (to help with the batter consistency), and 1 cup of chocolate chips. I baked it in a bundt cake pan at 335 degrees for 55-60 min. It turned out perfectly! Very rich and moist, but not at all wet or 'crispy' on the outside edges. Let it cool for an hour in the pan, then removed and drizzled the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site over it, garnished with strawberries and powdered sugar. Great presentation and great rich, chocolate taste. I would bake this again! I'll have a picture up soon.\nUpdate (10/24): Was wondering if anyone had used this recipe for cupcakes? Wasn't sure how the recipe would hold up when baked in a smaller size. Thanks!",

But I've had so much trouble lately with  getting my chocolate cakes moist because of the high altitude I'm at, so I'll try anything. It turned out perfect. I cooked it in 9\" cake pans for a birthday cake filled it with raspberry & frosted with chocolate buttercream. Everyone raved about it, and it was so moist. I used the mini chocolate chips and they were perfect, melted totally. My husband said it was almost like a brownie cake. Great for decorating because it holds it shape and doesn't crumble. It will be my standard chocolate cake recipe, can't wait to try it again with different fillings and frostings. Yum!!!",

I replaced the h2o with strong coffee and used a bag (11.5 oz.) of Ghirardelli's 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips. I used 1 round and 1 8x8 pan so that I could cut the round cake in half and push it against 2 of the squares sides to form a heart. These baked perfectly at 330 for 45 minutes. I topped it with whipped cream and strawberries I dipped in chocolate. This made a good sized heart cake that was devoured in 2 nights. It was so rich and chocolate-y that we could not keep our hands off of it. Thank you for the fabulous recipe!",

I love that this cake is guaranteed to rise and have a fine texture due to the cake and pudding mixes yet it is lifted from being 'just a cake mix' by the addition of sour cream and the chocolate chips.\n\nI found this cake very easy to make and it was a blessing in disguise that the top of the cake rose above the rim of my tin.  When the cake cooled, I was able to cut a perfectly flat base for the cake.. and thus sample the cake warm.  It was bliss when eaten with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.\n\nI followed reccommendations of other reviewers by cutting the oil to 1/2 cup, adding 1/3 cup milk and cutting back the chocolate chips to about 1 1/4 cups, or a large bag of chocolate chips in Australian brands.\n\nI agree that this cake is enough without a glaze, but as I'm making this for a birthday (mine!!) - I will be topping it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.\n\nThis is a great recipe to have when you need a special cake quickly and with the minimum of fuss.\n\nTwo thumbs up!  I am sure the chocoholics in my family will polish this up tonight.",

I usually make the cake in regular cake pans, slice the cakes in half lengthwise, and spread seedless raspberry preserves on each cut half. Then I place the layers back together and frost the cake sides, top, and between each cake with \"Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting\" (also on this site). Chocolate doesn't get any better than this! Thanks, Denise for such a wonderful chocolate cake recipe!",

        "reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS:  Well despite wanting to say I made a cake from \"scratch\" as I hate any boxed items, I tried this & the soldiers loved it!  I only use 1/2C of olive oil (more would leave the outside crispy), 1/3C milk (helped w/consistency), 1C chocolate chips (more is too much & just a waste) & greased generously w/PAM to prevent any problems.  From a baking video, it's best to cut out a piece of wax/parchment paper in shape of what you're baking in & put on bottom, so you can easily take out & work w/layers. Also, I wanted to make sure some 1st timers didn't make the same mistake I did the 1st time I made this.  I forgot about the chocolate chips so when checking to see if this was done, I almost overcooked it b/c my toothpick kept coming up with what I thought was batter.  DOH!! Cooking at 335 for 55 minutes was perfect.  I used Satiny Chocolate Glaze like many others but had no idea it really wasn't a glaze but came on more like a frosting.  Next time I'll try a more traditional chocolate frosting as the kids kept wondering what all that fancy gooey stuff that did not taste \"great\" was instead of their normal chocolatey frosting. :)",

I use a 7 minute frosting and fold in about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and let sit just until they barely start to melt.

Those that are leavened with baking soda require natural (non-Dutch processed) cocoa so that the alkalinity of the baking soda can neutralize the acidic cocoa. Recipes leavened with baking powder require Dutch-process cocoa to maintain the neutral pH of both.\r\nI used parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan and up the sides to lift out the cake (8x8pan). The rest I made as cupcakes. The cupcakes cooked more evenly in less time. \r\n",

I made it for my son's 8th bday with the chocolate icing found on the berry glazed chocolate cake recipe on this site. Everyone at the party (the adults especially) asked for the recipe. Most are not cake fans but even my dad said it was so good he finished the cake before his ice cream. I will make this over and over again--in fact I am making cupcakes today. MMMM! I forgot to add that we don't drink coffee so I used Mexican Stephens Hot Cocoa instead and it gave it a nice flavor- I imagine you could use any flavored hot chocolate and it would add a nice flavor. I also used 2 tsp of vanilla - I am sure you could use different flavoring too. I love this recipe. ADDITIONAL COMMENT: I have made this several times since my first time and was even asked to bring it to my sisters 30th birthday-her request. It is the best cake recipe- I make bundt cakes and sprinkle powdered sugar and I make mini bundts and cupcakes- time is a little over half the time as a cake- 20-25 minutes. they melt in your mouth. This time I didn't have milk so I added powdered with the dry and water with 1 tbsp vinegar. It was fabulous I won't make another. UPDATE: ok so I have made this again for the umteenth time and it turns out great everytime. I have used Pero in place of coffee and the satiny chocolate glaze is amazing...",

After stirring in the powdered sugar DO work quickly to spread it on the cake. It does become like fudge consistency as it cools. #2 If you have not checked to see how level your oven is you may want to do that before you start. An unlevel surface does show alot on a sheet cake. Wonderful recipe!! You won't be disappointed!! Thanks!!!!!!!",

This was super easy to make. Make sure that you prepare the icing when you are able to put on the cake while it is still warm, preferably right out of the oven. The icing gets stiff fast so the warm cake helps it spread. My family also loves to pair this up with vanilla ice cream. Being from San Antonio where pecan trees are in the back yard, we only make this with pecans, not walnuts. If you are one to worry about calories and fat content this recipe isn't for you, enjoy!  ;-)",

I made it for company last night and I am being tempted with what is left of this large delicious cake! This was the first time making this cake...I was pleasantly surprised. If you like chocolate I don't see how you wouldn't like this cake. It is moist and rich but not too rich where you say you can't eat it(obviously I am not having that problem). I made it in a 10x15 pan that I thought was only good for making my cookies. I used Baker's Joy cooking spray to grease my pan(very easy). This is a thinner cake but I liked it the way it was. You have a better icing to cake ratio this way:) I suggest starting the icing approx. 10 minutes prior to the cake coming out of the oven. That way the cake is done right when you are done with the icing.",

Make this and you will look like a pro!\nMy suggestions:\n1) use 4x as much instant coffee powder in cake batter, and make 2 layers of coffee flavored cake\n2)  i followed another reviewer's suggestion for substituting mascarpone with a mix of cream cheese, sour cream, and heavy cream, and it tastes great and is cheaper\n3)  you must turn the cake upside down when layering, otherwise coffee liqueur will not soak into it\n4)  i used kahlua for liqueur\n5)  I used Duncan Hines supreme white cake mix-it is moist and uses egg whites\n6)  i used a very strong espresso instead of the coffee to give it more flavor...also, instead of making coffee/espresso, just add water to some of the instant coffee powder, it tastes just fine in the cake",

Everyone agreed it was great.  The frosting was not overly sweet like some can be.  I would, however add more coffee/liquor mixture to the layers next time.  I was afraid the cake would taste too \"boozy\", as there are members of my family that dont drink, but the taste was very subtle.  (good for those that dont like the coffee taste)  I also made the cake layers days ahead of time and simply froze them, took them out of the freezer and assembled the cake the day before the party. When I sprinkled the cocoa powder on the cake I  first carefully placed a paper \"lace\" doily on the cake top and when removed the cake had the lace pattern on top.",

I followed the instructions to detail afterward.  Follow these tips for outstanding results: 1. Instead of mixing the instant coffee into the batter, mix 1/4 cup of water with about 1 tbsp of instant cofee powder and mix into the batter.  It tastes like an awesome mocha cake. 2. Also, be generous with the coffee mixture as you're pouring it over your cakes, that way the cake is MOIST.  Don't overdo it though! 3. Buy your MASCARPONE CHEESE at Trader Joes or Sams Club (even cheaper)...it's significantly cheaper there than any other grocery store that I went to. Excellent recipe!! thank you.",

Following the advice of previous reviews I make two of the layers with the coffee granulars and one without doubled the Kahlua everywhere it was called for and doubled the brewed coffee. I was amazed how fast this came together. Because the layers are so thin they cook and cool very fast. I think I had the whole thing done in under 45 minutes. As a variation I made this recipe for my husband's birthday and left out all the coffee kahlua and coffee granulars and added Chambord to two of the layers layered sliced strawberries over her marscapone cheese between the cake layers and pressed more slices into the side of the whipped cream frosting. It was very good like a strawberry shortcake cake.",

        "reviewBody": "WOW!!!  Follow the instruction and hand-stir the boiling water VERY thoroughly.  You will end up with a somewhat soupy, but uniform, batter.  I had no problem, as some did.  I used two 9\" pans, but only filled them 2/3 of the way and had some batter left, which I tossed out.  (I was afraid of overflowing the pans.)  This batter cooked up high and perfect!  To avoid problems de-panning it: make sure you use the toothpick test and also touch the top to make sure it springs back.  If you take it out too soon, you'll have a wet mess.  And follow the instructions and let it sit AT LEAST 10 minutes before de-panning it.  The frosting was an amazing consistency!  Creamy and easy to work with.  Add a little extra milk if it is not creamy enough and alternate the milk/cocoa/sugar as recommended.  I measured the 10X sugar per the recipe, but then added it a little at a time \"to taste.\"  I ended up with about a half cup of 10X left.  If you split the layers, you will have sufficient frosting.  I did not split the layers and had a ton leftover.  This cake was UNBELIEVABLE.  Moist, dense cake - not too sweet - and creamy delicious frosting.  I made it the day before a party and covered it tightly and it was perfect the next day.  Better than bakery cake.  Better than any chocolate cake I have ever had!!!  My guests' eyes were rolling back into their heads, this cake was THAT good.  This doesn't get 5 stars, it gets 10!!",

        "reviewBody": "WOW!!!  Follow the instruction and hand-stir the boiling water VERY thoroughly.  You will end up with a somewhat soupy, but uniform, batter.  I had no problem, as some did.  I used two 9\" pans, but only filled them 2/3 of the way and had some batter left, which I tossed out.  (I was afraid of overflowing the pans.)  This batter cooked up high and perfect!  To avoid problems de-panning it: make sure you use the toothpick test and also touch the top to make sure it springs back.  If you take it out too soon, you'll have a wet mess.  And follow the instructions and let it sit AT LEAST 10 minutes before de-panning it.  The frosting was an amazing consistency!  Creamy and easy to work with.  Add a little extra milk if it is not creamy enough and alternate the milk/cocoa/sugar as recommended.  I measured the 10X sugar per the recipe, but then added it a little at a time \"to taste.\"  I ended up with about a half cup of 10X left.  If you split the layers, you will have sufficient frosting.  I did not split the layers and had a ton leftover.  This cake was UNBELIEVABLE.  Moist, dense cake - not too sweet - and creamy delicious frosting.  I made it the day before a party and covered it tightly and it was perfect the next day.  Better than bakery cake.  Better than any chocolate cake I have ever had!!!  My guests' eyes were rolling back into their heads, this cake was THAT good.  This doesn't get 5 stars, it gets 10!!",

        "reviewBody": "This recipe is nearly identical to a recipe I have been using for 20 years. The only difference is that my recipe calls for 1 cup of cold water and 1 cup of piping hot coffee in place of the milk and boiling water. This time, I tried it with the milk and hot coffee, and I loved the result. There are 2 tricks to getting the layers out of the pan intact. The first is to use the right kind of pan. I use extra-heavy Wilton 9\" round cake pans. They have slightly higher sides than conventional cake pans and they are made of pale aluminum with a dull finish. This helps the cake cook evenly, but it also ensures that the cake develops a crust flexible enough to withstand turning the cake out onto the cooling racks. The second trick is to grease the pan heavily and then flour it. A light wipe with a greasy paper towel might make the flour stick, but it won't be enough to keep the cake from sticking to the pan. I lied. There is a third trick. Turn the cake out onto a cooling rack precisely 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven. That gives the cake time to firm up a bit, but not enough time for the shortening you used to grease the pan to adhere to the cake. And yes, the recipe yields a soupy batter. It's supposed to be that way. Don't use a springform pan. If your cake overflows the pan, you are probably using dutch process cocoa instead of regular unsweetened cocoa powder or a premium cocoa. Don't. You need the acidity of Hershey's regular to offset all that baking soda.",

The secret is to bake and frost this cake one day ahead of time. It's good/great the first day, but unbelievable the second day. I have also substituted part or all the regular unsweetened chocolate with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder when I make it for dark chocolate lovers. Hint: do NOT grease the sides of the pan so that your cake can \"climb\" up the sides. Your cake will bake level without puffing in the middle and you wont have to cut off the hump to level it. Just run a very sharp knife around the outside of the pan when fully baked and cooled for 15-20 minutes and remove it. This method gives you more crumbs on the sides, but a much nicer shaped cake. You can control the crumbs when you frost  by \"dirty icing\" the cake. To dirty ice, split the layers horizontally and place back together with icing in between each layer. Then, frost the whole cake with a very thin layer of icing  to \"cement\" the crumbs. Wait a few minutes for the dirty icing layer to harden slightly, then frost the cake.",

I have also made this recipe into an ice cream cake and it worked wonderfully. Just remember not to overbake it. For an ice cream cake, pour batter into 2 identical springform pans. Bake as directed, coolcompletely, then slice in half horizontally so you have 4 cake layers. Then place the bottomlayer back in the springform pan, top with softened ice cream, anotherlayer ofcake, more ice cream, another cake, more ice cream, then cake! Takes about a half gallon of ice cream. Freeze completely, prob overnight, open sides of pan. Then I ice a thin layer, put back in freezer for an hour or so, then frostcake as usual! Store in freezer until right before serving! It's been a hit several times over!",

Vanilla whipped cream would be a great accompaniment. Unaccompanied, it's nice but a little too plain.\r\n\r\nCaution: grease the pan quite well, as the cake is clingy when hot and you don't want to tear it.",

        "reviewBody": "I have made this cake recipe for every family birthday for the last 4 or 5 years. I have 4 children so I know this recipe off by heart now! It is a little crumbly but I make it the day before and put it in the fridge. This seams to change it into a very moist cake. I consider this a good thing because then I always have the cake ready ahead of time. It does stick in your pans terribly so be sure to line your pans with baking paper (or parchment) and not just butter or butter and flour them. This is a really delicious cake. I would make something different for each birthday but my husband and kids ask for this chocolate cake every time. Now if they would only learn the recipe and make it on my birthday.....ha ha.",

        "reviewBody": "Thanks so much for the recipe! I've made this cake twice to rave reviews. I almost didn't try it because of the warnings about its dryness from other users. If you are getting a dry cake from this recipe I believe it could be a technical issue. Insufficient creaming of the butter and sugar could cause the cake to be dry. I allow at least 2 minutes of moderate-speed blending. I also used butter-flavored Crisco (1c butter = 1c Crisco 6t water) which can also make it moister. You could also be overbaking either by giving it too much time in the oven or by having an oven that's too hot. If you enjoy baking do yourself a favor and invest 6.00 in an oven thermometer. You won't regret it!",

Topped it with cream cheese frosting (8 oz + 1 c powdered sugar, milk and Vanilla). Very good. Made it in a 9 x 13, baked it for about 35 minutes. It was a very thick cake, but not too dense and went over very well. Not as chocolate as I would have hoped for tho but a nice alternative from scratch.",

I don't change the ingredients, but I DO change the method, so if anyone is interested I will describe.  I grease and flour two 9in cake rounds.  Sift all of the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl.  Add the wet ingredients, and stir with a spoon until it's combined.  The vinegar will bubble with the baking soda.. it's supposed to.  The batter will be thin, but that's normal from what I can tell.  Although the recipe calls for a 13x9, when I baked it in that pan it took much longer than called for.  In the two 9in rounds, 30 minutes is perfect.  The cake is moist and there is ABSOLUTELY NO Vinegar taste.. AT ALL.  If you want a super duper chocolatey flavor, replace 1c of the water with coffee.  I know it sounds weird, but you won't taste the coffee.. only enhanced chocolate.  I'm no expert, but like I said.. every time I prepare the cake with this method, it is perfect.",

He also couldn't eat vinegar or chocolate, so Amatullah's suggestion about the orange cake conversion was great.  I substituted the cocoa with cornstarch and the vinegar with orange juice, and I added a teaspoon of orange zest.  I also exchanged the baking soda for baking powder.  It turned out perfectly!  If you're making the orange cake, I would suggest frosting it with Adora Marchi's \"Mom's Buttercream Frosting,\" sprinkling a pinch of lemon zest over the frosting, and putting a slice of fresh orange on top.  Be sure to cool the cake completely before applying the frosting.  Thanks Amy and Amatullah; you made my father's birthday very memorable.",

I also used half of Hershey s Dark cocoa as well as regular unsweetened cocoa. Using the cake as a base I added the following loosely following another recipe: Once cake cooled I poked holes into each cake using a long tined fork then poured a mix of cherry juice and slight amount of brandy onto each cake. Then I used a mix of.5 cup creamed butter.3 cup of /granulated sugar and almond extract to make a buttercream filling and put a layer on one of the cakes. I put one can of cherry pie filling (excluding juice) on that same cake then topped with slightly sweetened heavy whipping cream. I put the other cake on top then laid another can of cherry pie filling sans juice on top followed with more whipped cream. I used 2 cups of liquid heavy whipping cream when I made the cream for the middle and top of cake which was perfect. I had one slice right away and while it was good thought it was missing something but didn t know what. The cherries were somehow boring as well. The next day somehow it was wonderful! It was very moist and the flavors were enhanced. I originally thought the buttercream was a waste of time; however each day that passes (day 3 now) the filling flavor comes out more and really makes this cake! I will definitely use this recipe for any chocolate cakes I make from now on!",

        "reviewBody": "Fantastic fudgey, moist cake. I love it for two reasons -- it's versatile and easy, it even works in a high-altitude area, like Denver where I live. I use white whole wheat flour (King Arthur and Wheat Montana sell a white spring kernel variety, which is lighter and sweeter than regular whole wheat, but just as nutritious), and it still tastes like regular chocolate cake. Also, I can trim the fat without it tasting low-fat.I replace 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the oil with applesauce or mashed pear (use a small hole grater on an apple if you don't have any applesauce). I've made this recipe three times now, and when I'm not being health-conscious, I love it with chocolate glaze. I make a quick one with cocoa powder (mix 2 TBS oil, 2 TBS melted butter, 2TBS Karo syrup, 2 tsp vanilla, 6 TBS cocoa powder, 1.5 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 cup milk or more depending on your desired consistency).",

Thanks a gain for the terrific recipe and new family favorite. P. S. My husband is very finicky about vegetables even when they're in breads or cakes and he really loves this cake.",

And instead of using all, all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup of all-purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat. I also cut the sugar in half because the applesauce is sweet so that would make up for some of the missing sugar and then I added a tsp of vanilla. Anyway, when I brought this cake to my friends birthday party, everybody raved about it! Even my friend who hates all vegetables and fruits LOVED it (she still doesn't know that it was a zucchini cake because I haven't told her yet). AWESOME cake :)",

We all agreed that 1 cup was just right - too much more would have resulted in a dense greasy cake. No need to use applesauce for some of the oil either. This cake was perfectly moist with just 1 cup of oil. We also left out the nuts which was just fine. I used olive oil as I do with most of my baking and it was great. We all agreed the cake tasted better room temp the next day rather than warm out of the oven. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",

One tip, which made this even easier to make: I used seedless raspberry jam instead of cooking the raspberries on the stove. I just microwaved 6 tablespoons of jam for 30 seconds before adding to the cheesecake. It was so much easier and tasted fantastic! I also microwaved the white chocolate with half-and-half with excellent results. I will definitely make this again! Everyone was so impressed!",

If you're using smashed up Oreos for your chocolate cookie crumbs (which is what I do), then you don't need anywhere near as much butter or sugar in the crust; the Oreo creamy filling provides lots of sweetness and stick-it-together-ness.  I use 2 cups crushed Oreos, only one tablespoon sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter -- the crust comes out perfect that way.  Also, I'm not sure if I just have delinquently leaky springform pans or what, but the first time I made this, I ended up with melted butter dripping down from the bottom of the pan all over the bottom of my oven (quite a mess).  Now I put a jelly roll pan on the oven shelf below to catch the dripping butter, and all is well.  :-)  I have ended up with a few cracks in the top of the cheesecake each time I have made this, but once I pile on tons of white chocolate shavings/curls, no one is the wiser!  This cheesecake absolutely could NOT taste better -- people go CRAZY over it.",

Everyone who tried the last one said it was better than my mom's cheesecake... and that's saying a ton! \n\nA couple things though.. make sure you check it 15 minutes early. If it looks done in the over it will be OVER DONE on your plate! Tap the side of the pan with a spoon and if it jiggles as \"one piece\" rather than like jello, it's done. if it doesn't jiggle at all it's over done. \n\nAnd, If you're using a springform pan, you can put prachment paper on the bottom and it will just slide off the pan easly when it's time to cut it. \n\nAnd as for cutting perfect, clean pieces - run a clean, long, thin knife under hot water. Quickly dry it off with a towell and slice straight down and out. Repeat for EVERY SLICE! Yes, it will take a while - but you'll have beautiful, perfect slices. ^_^",

The first time i made it, I too, had a lot of trouble getting the raspberry seeds out which made the \"raspberry swirl\" almost non-existent, however, it tasted wonderful. The SECOND time I made it, I made just a few changes. I made it in a 10\" springform pan, and used 4 cups of white chocolate chips to give it extra white chocolate flavor. I also doubled the water to make the raspberry sauce and added 3.5 tablespoons of sugar, which made it drain out and taste wonderfully! I will always make it like that now, and encourage everyone to try this recipe no matter how they make it, or what alterations they make!",

        "reviewBody": "I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday and it was heavenly! It has a creamy texture with undertones of white chocolate and raspberry. My sister-in-law said it tasted \"professional.\" I doubled the crust using 2 cups of Oreo cookies, 1/4 cup of butter and 1 T. of sugar. Double the raspberry sauce. It's easier to puree the raspberries with the sugar, press the ingredients through a fine-mesh stainer and then cook it. I added 6 T. of raspberry sauce to the cake without it overpowering the taste. The white chocolate and half-and-half can be safely microwaved on HI for 1 minute, stirred throroughly, microwaved and stirred thoroughly. 2-1/2 to 3 minutes should do it. To prevent any leakage, I use a 9\" x 3\" cake pan.  Spray the bottom with Pam, add parchmant paper to the bottom and spray the parchmant. Cook the cheesecake in a water bath for the designated time. Remove from the water bath, carefully loosen the sides of the cake with an offset cake knife, then immediately refrigerate - uncovered - until morning. Never a crack. To remove the cake from the pan, heat water to almost boiling and gently dip the pan in (about 1\") for 10 seconds. Turn the pan over on a large flat plate, tap the bottom and lift the pan away from the cake. Invert cake onto serving plate. If cake stays in pan, repeat the process. The cheesecake will not fall. I always do this with excellent results.",

It's like the raspberry sauce had soaked into it. On top it looked beautiful (see picture) so I was very surprised that it didn't hold its texture well. I served it at a guild function and there wasn't one \"swoon\" which these ladies do for great decadent desserts. Not one request for the recipe which is always the usual course of things (as a chef I hate being asked to give out recipes. It's like asking a doctor to give out free prescriptions. But with this recipe I didn't have to worry - no requests.) It tasted fine though nothing spectacular. The white chocolate cannot even be tasted especially disappointing since I used expensive imported Belgian white chocolate. I shouldn't have bothered. I've made many other cheesecakes including just straight ones with no specialty flavorings that were much better. I'm a chef and have worked extensively as a caterer and pastry chef so no rookie here. As cheesecakes go this was merely OK. Not bad but certainly not exceptional. I know that flies in the face of all the other glowing reviews but I'm being completely honest. At best I'd describe this as aggressively mediocre.",

This cake turned out GREAT, and my friend was very complimentary of it!  Since a mixer part was missing in action, we did all the mixing and beating by hand, and it still turned out just fine.  It was very moist, had great shape and texture, and looked beautiful after adding the chocolate drizzle. \r\n\r\nThe next time I make it, though, I will ADD TWO EXTRA OUNCES OF CHOCOLATE TO THE CAKE MIXTURE, to make it just a touch chocolate-ier.  Also, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE ONE AND A HALF RECIPES OF THE FILLING/FROSTING. One recipe of it would not be enough, and 1 1/2 is just right.  Also, TOAST THE COCONUT AND PECANS.  That makes them much, much better.  Be careful about burning the coconut.  It toasts very quickly.  A great cake that we will probably make a lot!  Well worth the trouble.",

        "reviewBody": "Upon researching for hours for a German Chocolate cake recipe worth the time to make and choosing this one, I bought the \"Bakers\" German sweet chocolate bar for use in this cake.  After opening the box of chocolate, there are recipes in there for frosting, cake and a few others using this chocolate.  Lo and behold the cake recipe they print is exactly the same as this one except this one says to use cake flour and 1/2 cup more of it.  Other than that it's exact.  I know this will be delicious as I've made this (the one off the box) years ago and it was awesome.  German Choc. cake is my all time favorite cake but is very time consuming to make by scratch so I don't make it often.  The frosting on the box is also worth the mention as there isn't one on this site that really stands out for such an exceptional cake.  It appears to resemble the Ger. Choc. cake frosting II on this site but it makes more which you would need for a proper 3 layer cake. I would suggest using the frosting recipe on the box and you won't be dissapointed. At least Dean knows his recipe for German Chocolate Cake!!",

        "reviewBody": "Great Cake! I read the reviews and agreed with these suggestions. It's a must to toast the coconut and pecans. A little salt to the icing would bring out the flavor better...so I added 1/4 teaspoon. I should mention that I mixed 1-1/2 times the icing recipe. I had no problem getting the icing to thicken, but it's important to bring your initial ingredients to a boil while stirring constantly. As soon as it starts to boil you can see it's thickening. Once it's cools and you add the coconut and pecans...it's plenty thick. I also put mine in the refrigerator to set up even better. The cake batter provides enough to more than fill 2- 9\" pans. Make sure you use CAKE flour not all purpose flour, it does make a difference. If you can't find cake flour, try bulk bins or go to your instore bakeries and ask them to sell you some. I found that the recipe produces too much batter and the cake rose over the edges of the pan and got crispy. ( not what you want on a cake )This also increases your baking time which is also what you do not want because it will make your cake drier. Next time I will remove 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter off each 9\" pan, that should make it perfect. The cake rises high and beautiful, I was very impressed! Lastly, I agreed that the cake was much better the next day..it got even more moist.I would make this cake the day before a special event to maximize the pleasure of this moist cake. I now believe I can make a cake from scratch with the moistness of a \"box\" cake! ..",

        "reviewBody": "I decided to make this cake for our anniversary after my husband told me that this was his favorite cake. This cake was very good light and moist. However I did follow the advice of others and made more filling. I used 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk 1 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup butter 4 slightly beated egg yolks 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla 2 1/3 cup coconut 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans and 2 tbsp. instant vanilla pudding. I followed the directions except I cooked on medium heat for about 12 minutes. The coconut and pecans were added after removing from heat. This made enough filling/frosting for between the layers and on top. Next time I will double Dean's recipe (adding the vanilla pudding and cooking on medium heat) so that I can have enough to frost the cake and omit the chocolate drizzle. We were not too crazy about that part.",

        "reviewBody": "I have made this cake for the cafe and my family over a hundred times now. You can make it as is and it is excellent or you can deviate. First word of advice: DO NOT FROST THE SIDES OR TOP OF THIS CAKE. It has a wonderful rustic look if you frost ONLY the internal layers. The chocolate topping is made with FAR too few squares of chocolate. Add extra and for each extra you add add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of shortening. I like to create a ganache shell on top of my cake so I pour chocolate there and spread it super thin then drizzle chocolate down the size. It gives it a beautiful rustic-artisan look. You can decorate the top of the cake by SPARINGLY sprinkling raw or toasted coconut (or chopped nuts) on top of the cake and then drizzling additional chocolate in a crisscross pattern over the top of that. Feel free to deviate in nuts you use - I often use hazelnuts along with pecans. I also often toast my coconut instead of using plain raw coconut. This will drastically change the flavors of the cake but it's always fun to deviate once in a while. Also when you make your layers place parchment paper on the bottom of your pans. Put the pan cake and all in the freezer until frozen. Place the bottom of the pan in hot water for about 10 to 20 seconds. This will warm the bottom of the cake. Remove the layers remove the parchment paper and cut the bulb off the top of each layer to make a perfectly round flat layer. This will increase presentability by 100%!",

Everything is the same except this recipe calls for 1/2 cup more flour(cake) and 1/4 teaspoon more salt. This recipe was ok not as moist flavorful or buttery as the recipe calling for 2 cups of flour. I did use cake flour recommended. I was quite disappointed and everyone said that my old recipe was so much better. i definitely agree. The chocolate color was not as intense (lighter brown) and cake tasted dry. I also toasted the pecans but I like the non toasted taste better for this cake. Will not try this recipe again but rather will stick by my old recipe. It is so much better. The frosting can be made the day before (used the recipe on the German chocolate bar). It is delicious ample enough to frost the entire cake.",

Used a devils food cake box 1/4 cup Godiva and 1/4 Kamora(just like Kahlua but 1/2 the price!) and only one cup of chocolate chips (mini is best but not essential). Used cocoa to dust the pan but you can also use a little of the chocolate cake mix if you don't have cocoa. Baked for 60mins. Had leftover chocolate ganache from a cake I made earlier in the week (that was WAY more work and not as good!) so poured that over the top and it looked stunning! Have been experimenting with different liquors every time I make this - Baileys Grand Marnier dark rum...My favorite liquor in this cake so far has been Chambord (raspberry) although Grand Marnier is very good too. FYI: Tia Maria Kahlua Kamora and Cafe Ole are all coffee flavored liquors (the last two being the cheapest). Godiva and Creme de Cacao are good for the chocolate flavored liquors. You could also make this non-alcoholic by using strong brewed coffee.",

I also used 1 cup of Irish cream flavored liquer which tastes much better and added more flavor. Have also substituted 2 tablespoon instant espresso powder in place of the liquer and was fantastic. Espresso really brings out the flavor of chocolate. Have also used Andes Mint Chocolate baking chips and it was to die for! Also use room temp. eggs which makes cake rise better. (If in a pinch soak cold eggs in very hot tap water for 5 min.) No need for glaze or frosting or this will be too sweet. Taste best with fresh strawberries/rasberries if available. If not dust with powdered sugar and you're good to go. So easy and taste very homemade!! TIP - You can use other cake mix flavors such as Vanilla and add the sour cream to make a moist dense yellow cake.",

        "reviewBody": "Incredible cake! I almost break out in hives at the thought of baking a BOXED cake...but I must give credit where it is due. I tried using one cup of chocolate chips at the suggestion of other reviewers and it's delicious. I prefer using the full 2 cups of mini chocolate chips though. I think it lends greatly to the gooey consistancy of the cake. Regular chocolate chips look like chips in cake...the minis seem to melt right in. I have also experimented with different liquors such as Kahlua and Godiva but try others for fun too. I think it's great with Bailey's which my husband liked but when I used my Aramula cream liqueur...he declared it the best chocolate cake in the world. It needs no icing...try a light dusting of powdered sugar for asthetics. Make sure you dust just before serving. This cake is so moist...the powdered sugar is quickly absorbed (and may look less than appealing). Also make sure you do flour the pan or use baker's joy. Once I only used oil and the cake didnt fall out as neatly.",

I used a can of dunkin hines vanilla frosting and with this the cake was good.  However, after mellowing in the fridge for a day or two this cake was insanely good!  As good as any store bought or boxed mix.  Bottom line:  Make the cake a day in advance and let it mellow in the fridge overnight.  I see no need to buy another boxed mix again.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh, and yes, after the water step it will be very soupy but it will turn out perfect :D",

You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing.",

The type of cocoa is crucial. I've cooked it twice first time used a dark cocoa it was good but the dark chocolate enhanced the salt so it tasted a tad salty. So next time if using a dark cocoa will omit the salt. Second time used good quality standard cocoa and came out great. Also used a diluted espresso instead of plain water. Also glad the writer noted the runniness of the mix abit worrying at first. Excellent recipe.",

For a point of reference, I have been buying the Trader Joe's flourless chocolate cake... this recipe is just as good if not better! I substituted 1/3C egg whites for two of the four eggs.  I also used  1/2 C milk chocolate chips and 1 C. semi sweet chips, and dusted the pan with unsweetened coco pwdr.

For all those reviewers who are giving this recipe 1/5 stars, you must NOT be following the recipe correctly.  It actually upsets me reading the negative reviews.  How is possible to be biting into a bean? You are supposed to be blending the beans into a smooth mixture via a food processor! How is it dry? The recipe calls for 4 eggs! Grainy? Again, mix via food processor to a smooth consistency and wash the beans thoroughly beforehand.  Not sweet enough or chocolately enough? Are you using the correct measuring spoons?! Anyone who follows this recipe to the exact T should be successful in making a delicious cake.  If you have a good quality food processor, a non stick baking pan, and you know how to read and follow instructions, this cake will turn out fantastic.  Good luck!",

        "reviewBody": "Great recipe.  Served it to 7 people & they all liked it.  My 12 year old daughter had 2 pieces.    I processed the beans ALOT & it was pretty smooth.  No one could taste the beans @ all but felt good about the fact that they were eating a dessert that was actually good for them.  We thought it was sweet enough, my sister in Law who is a health nut thought it was too sweet but she hates sweets altogether but it was fun to see her enjoying her cake & not feel guilty about it.  The only change I made was to put in more baking powder, added 1 tsp. vanilla and used brown sugar instead of white.  I will only add the stated amount of baking powder next time as I feel it will be better not being so airy.    The cake does look dry but then when eating it surprisingly it doesn't taste dry.  Kinda crumbly (but no one minded) so next time I will try adding some applesauce or butter or maybe even some Peanut butter.  Chocolate chips or chunks, nuts would also be good in it.    Really make sure by poking in the center as to when the cake is truly done.  Mine took longer to cook than stated.  This Recipe will be used over & over again, with variations as to additions and toppings, as a cake & as cupcakes. \n\nUPDATE Made it again, this time added toasted whole almonds as the food processor will chop them.  Added 1/3 cup applesauce  & a 1/4 cup coconut oil.  Wow it was perfect.  More fudgy tasting, less crumbly & the nutty bits were a nice treat.  Raspberries & dollop of cream on top perfect!",

I followed the recipe just as written on her blog and came out with a moist cupcake, slightly bitter filling, and a sweet buttercream that happily balanced out the ganache center.  I also went one step farther and mixed up a Bailey's Salted Caramel drizzle for the top and that took them over the top.  (For the drizzle, I used 1/2 cup caramel ice cream topping, a Tbsp of Bailey's, and salted it to taste. )  I'd definitely recommend making these!",

        "reviewBody": "So far folks love these...a perfect Patty's Day treat. A few notes on prep: FILLING: Melting chocolate is tricky business. Heat the cream slowly on low heat but make sure it is really simmering before adding the chocolate. If you end up with a chunky greasy mixture it means the chocolate didn't temper and you'll need to start over. FROSTING: I agree that the frosting as written isn't quite right and adding more Bailey's is not the best solution for making it fluffier. While it may seem like adding more confectioners sugar would stiffen it (like adding flour) it actually makes the frosting runnier. I increased the butter to 3/4 cup and it was perfect: both in quantity and in consistency.",

I just started getting into baking and these were very fun to make. One thing I learned is that these take a lot of time to make, especially if your a beginner.

I made the cupcakes exactly as written with modifications for our high altitude (over 5 000 ft.). The cupcakes were fantastic! The only thing that I might have done differently would be to increase the filling and frosting as I ran out of it before I had filled all of the cupcakes. I used the correct alcoholic mixture as well. FYI you can but small miniatures for the filling and frosting. Which is what I did. I also used good quality chocolate and cocoa for the recipe. These may take a while to make but they are truly awesome and worth all of the time involved. I also used my Wilton cupcake corer for the first time which may be why I needed extra filling. The corer once I figured it out made it easy to take out the extra cupcake material in the middle. I used the cupcake cores to make my Grandma Scherer's \"cake\". She could never get any cake to come out of the pan so she would crumble it up and fold it into whipped cream along with some fruit. I did the same with my middles adding dried cherries.",

I've only made the cake with 9 inch pans and there was barely enough batter for 2 layers so when I needed a larger cake I just doubled the recipe. I also make sure I make the frosting at least 1 night before I serve the cake because it takes some time for the sugar to fully dissolve but it is perfect the next day. I've also used white chocolate shavings to decorate the top of the cake and it makes it really classy professional looking. No one has to know that it started as a mix!",

To decorate I used hershey's hugs because of the brown and white stripes. It matched the inside and was a neat effect.",

I love oats so added an extra 1/4 cup. I subtracted a 1/4 cup flour to keep the dry measures the same. I only used whole wheat flour not all-purpose for part. This created a lovely brown bread. I used fennel seeds in place of the orange zest and I highly recommend this. Finally I realized at the last moment that I didn't have parchment paper so I greased my cast iron skillet and made one large loaf. My husband and I already ate half with dinner!",

Took a lot of work because the dough is so wet and sticky, getting it to set a little so I could handle it was a test of my patience.

However it is a delightful tasting bread...perfect for breakfast or brunch.  It tastes more like a moister scone!  I made it with all the listed ingredients except substituted steel cut oats for the rolled oats (steel cut oats are the secret ingredient for true Irish soda bread).  Can't say I really noticed them in this bread.  Also used 1/4 cup Craisens because that is what I had.  Baked the loaves for the time stated but did so in a metal roaster pan with parchment in the bottom.  Took off the lid to brown the last 10 minutes.  They were baked perfectly.  I bake my artisan bread in the roaster pan to keep them moist....works very well!",

        "reviewBody": "I made the recipe pretty much as written. I increased whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased all purpose to 2 3/4 cups. The dough was so wet and unmanageable. I had to dust frequently with flour just to get it off the kneading surface and my hands. So I probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. That is why it has a 3 star rating. On the upside I loved the flavor and especially the orange zest that sets it apart from other soda breads. The texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I might make this again...and maybe decreased the buttermilk.",
