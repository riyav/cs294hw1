Slight changes: I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix, with 1/2 cup veg. oil and 1/3 cup milk (to help with the batter consistency), and 1 cup of chocolate chips. I baked it in a bundt cake pan at 335 degrees for 55-60 min. It turned out perfectly! Very rich and moist, but not at all wet or 'crispy' on the outside edges. Let it cool for an hour in the pan, then removed and drizzled the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site over it, garnished with strawberries and powdered sugar. Great presentation and great rich, chocolate taste. I would bake this again! I'll have a picture up soon.\nUpdate (10/24): Was wondering if anyone had used this recipe for cupcakes? Wasn't sure how the recipe would hold up when baked in a smaller size. Thanks!",

But I've had so much trouble lately with  getting my chocolate cakes moist because of the high altitude I'm at, so I'll try anything. It turned out perfect. I cooked it in 9\" cake pans for a birthday cake filled it with raspberry & frosted with chocolate buttercream. Everyone raved about it, and it was so moist. I used the mini chocolate chips and they were perfect, melted totally. My husband said it was almost like a brownie cake. Great for decorating because it holds it shape and doesn't crumble. It will be my standard chocolate cake recipe, can't wait to try it again with different fillings and frostings. Yum!!!",

I replaced the h2o with strong coffee and used a bag (11.5 oz.) of Ghirardelli's 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate chips. I used 1 round and 1 8x8 pan so that I could cut the round cake in half and push it against 2 of the squares sides to form a heart. These baked perfectly at 330 for 45 minutes. I topped it with whipped cream and strawberries I dipped in chocolate. This made a good sized heart cake that was devoured in 2 nights. It was so rich and chocolate-y that we could not keep our hands off of it. Thank you for the fabulous recipe!",

I love that this cake is guaranteed to rise and have a fine texture due to the cake and pudding mixes yet it is lifted from being 'just a cake mix' by the addition of sour cream and the chocolate chips.\n\nI found this cake very easy to make and it was a blessing in disguise that the top of the cake rose above the rim of my tin.  When the cake cooled, I was able to cut a perfectly flat base for the cake.. and thus sample the cake warm.  It was bliss when eaten with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.\n\nI followed reccommendations of other reviewers by cutting the oil to 1/2 cup, adding 1/3 cup milk and cutting back the chocolate chips to about 1 1/4 cups, or a large bag of chocolate chips in Australian brands.\n\nI agree that this cake is enough without a glaze, but as I'm making this for a birthday (mine!!) - I will be topping it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.\n\nThis is a great recipe to have when you need a special cake quickly and with the minimum of fuss.\n\nTwo thumbs up!  I am sure the chocoholics in my family will polish this up tonight.",

I usually make the cake in regular cake pans, slice the cakes in half lengthwise, and spread seedless raspberry preserves on each cut half. Then I place the layers back together and frost the cake sides, top, and between each cake with \"Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting\" (also on this site). Chocolate doesn't get any better than this! Thanks, Denise for such a wonderful chocolate cake recipe!",

        "reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS:  Well despite wanting to say I made a cake from \"scratch\" as I hate any boxed items, I tried this & the soldiers loved it!  I only use 1/2C of olive oil (more would leave the outside crispy), 1/3C milk (helped w/consistency), 1C chocolate chips (more is too much & just a waste) & greased generously w/PAM to prevent any problems.  From a baking video, it's best to cut out a piece of wax/parchment paper in shape of what you're baking in & put on bottom, so you can easily take out & work w/layers. Also, I wanted to make sure some 1st timers didn't make the same mistake I did the 1st time I made this.  I forgot about the chocolate chips so when checking to see if this was done, I almost overcooked it b/c my toothpick kept coming up with what I thought was batter.  DOH!! Cooking at 335 for 55 minutes was perfect.  I used Satiny Chocolate Glaze like many others but had no idea it really wasn't a glaze but came on more like a frosting.  Next time I'll try a more traditional chocolate frosting as the kids kept wondering what all that fancy gooey stuff that did not taste \"great\" was instead of their normal chocolatey frosting. :)",

I use a 7 minute frosting and fold in about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and let sit just until they barely start to melt.

Those that are leavened with baking soda require natural (non-Dutch processed) cocoa so that the alkalinity of the baking soda can neutralize the acidic cocoa. Recipes leavened with baking powder require Dutch-process cocoa to maintain the neutral pH of both.\r\nI used parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan and up the sides to lift out the cake (8x8pan). The rest I made as cupcakes. The cupcakes cooked more evenly in less time. \r\n",

I made it for my son's 8th bday with the chocolate icing found on the berry glazed chocolate cake recipe on this site. Everyone at the party (the adults especially) asked for the recipe. Most are not cake fans but even my dad said it was so good he finished the cake before his ice cream. I will make this over and over again--in fact I am making cupcakes today. MMMM! I forgot to add that we don't drink coffee so I used Mexican Stephens Hot Cocoa instead and it gave it a nice flavor- I imagine you could use any flavored hot chocolate and it would add a nice flavor. I also used 2 tsp of vanilla - I am sure you could use different flavoring too. I love this recipe. ADDITIONAL COMMENT: I have made this several times since my first time and was even asked to bring it to my sisters 30th birthday-her request. It is the best cake recipe- I make bundt cakes and sprinkle powdered sugar and I make mini bundts and cupcakes- time is a little over half the time as a cake- 20-25 minutes. they melt in your mouth. This time I didn't have milk so I added powdered with the dry and water with 1 tbsp vinegar. It was fabulous I won't make another. UPDATE: ok so I have made this again for the umteenth time and it turns out great everytime. I have used Pero in place of coffee and the satiny chocolate glaze is amazing...",

After stirring in the powdered sugar DO work quickly to spread it on the cake. It does become like fudge consistency as it cools. #2 If you have not checked to see how level your oven is you may want to do that before you start. An unlevel surface does show alot on a sheet cake. Wonderful recipe!! You won't be disappointed!! Thanks!!!!!!!",

This was super easy to make. Make sure that you prepare the icing when you are able to put on the cake while it is still warm, preferably right out of the oven. The icing gets stiff fast so the warm cake helps it spread. My family also loves to pair this up with vanilla ice cream. Being from San Antonio where pecan trees are in the back yard, we only make this with pecans, not walnuts. If you are one to worry about calories and fat content this recipe isn't for you, enjoy!  ;-)",

I made it for company last night and I am being tempted with what is left of this large delicious cake! This was the first time making this cake...I was pleasantly surprised. If you like chocolate I don't see how you wouldn't like this cake. It is moist and rich but not too rich where you say you can't eat it(obviously I am not having that problem). I made it in a 10x15 pan that I thought was only good for making my cookies. I used Baker's Joy cooking spray to grease my pan(very easy). This is a thinner cake but I liked it the way it was. You have a better icing to cake ratio this way:) I suggest starting the icing approx. 10 minutes prior to the cake coming out of the oven. That way the cake is done right when you are done with the icing.",

Make this and you will look like a pro!\nMy suggestions:\n1) use 4x as much instant coffee powder in cake batter, and make 2 layers of coffee flavored cake\n2)  i followed another reviewer's suggestion for substituting mascarpone with a mix of cream cheese, sour cream, and heavy cream, and it tastes great and is cheaper\n3)  you must turn the cake upside down when layering, otherwise coffee liqueur will not soak into it\n4)  i used kahlua for liqueur\n5)  I used Duncan Hines supreme white cake mix-it is moist and uses egg whites\n6)  i used a very strong espresso instead of the coffee to give it more flavor...also, instead of making coffee/espresso, just add water to some of the instant coffee powder, it tastes just fine in the cake",

Everyone agreed it was great.  The frosting was not overly sweet like some can be.  I would, however add more coffee/liquor mixture to the layers next time.  I was afraid the cake would taste too \"boozy\", as there are members of my family that dont drink, but the taste was very subtle.  (good for those that dont like the coffee taste)  I also made the cake layers days ahead of time and simply froze them, took them out of the freezer and assembled the cake the day before the party. When I sprinkled the cocoa powder on the cake I  first carefully placed a paper \"lace\" doily on the cake top and when removed the cake had the lace pattern on top.",

I followed the instructions to detail afterward.  Follow these tips for outstanding results: 1. Instead of mixing the instant coffee into the batter, mix 1/4 cup of water with about 1 tbsp of instant cofee powder and mix into the batter.  It tastes like an awesome mocha cake. 2. Also, be generous with the coffee mixture as you're pouring it over your cakes, that way the cake is MOIST.  Don't overdo it though! 3. Buy your MASCARPONE CHEESE at Trader Joes or Sams Club (even cheaper)...it's significantly cheaper there than any other grocery store that I went to. Excellent recipe!! thank you.",

Following the advice of previous reviews I make two of the layers with the coffee granulars and one without doubled the Kahlua everywhere it was called for and doubled the brewed coffee. I was amazed how fast this came together. Because the layers are so thin they cook and cool very fast. I think I had the whole thing done in under 45 minutes. As a variation I made this recipe for my husband's birthday and left out all the coffee kahlua and coffee granulars and added Chambord to two of the layers layered sliced strawberries over her marscapone cheese between the cake layers and pressed more slices into the side of the whipped cream frosting. It was very good like a strawberry shortcake cake.",

        "reviewBody": "WOW!!!  Follow the instruction and hand-stir the boiling water VERY thoroughly.  You will end up with a somewhat soupy, but uniform, batter.  I had no problem, as some did.  I used two 9\" pans, but only filled them 2/3 of the way and had some batter left, which I tossed out.  (I was afraid of overflowing the pans.)  This batter cooked up high and perfect!  To avoid problems de-panning it: make sure you use the toothpick test and also touch the top to make sure it springs back.  If you take it out too soon, you'll have a wet mess.  And follow the instructions and let it sit AT LEAST 10 minutes before de-panning it.  The frosting was an amazing consistency!  Creamy and easy to work with.  Add a little extra milk if it is not creamy enough and alternate the milk/cocoa/sugar as recommended.  I measured the 10X sugar per the recipe, but then added it a little at a time \"to taste.\"  I ended up with about a half cup of 10X left.  If you split the layers, you will have sufficient frosting.  I did not split the layers and had a ton leftover.  This cake was UNBELIEVABLE.  Moist, dense cake - not too sweet - and creamy delicious frosting.  I made it the day before a party and covered it tightly and it was perfect the next day.  Better than bakery cake.  Better than any chocolate cake I have ever had!!!  My guests' eyes were rolling back into their heads, this cake was THAT good.  This doesn't get 5 stars, it gets 10!!",

        "reviewBody": "WOW!!!  Follow the instruction and hand-stir the boiling water VERY thoroughly.  You will end up with a somewhat soupy, but uniform, batter.  I had no problem, as some did.  I used two 9\" pans, but only filled them 2/3 of the way and had some batter left, which I tossed out.  (I was afraid of overflowing the pans.)  This batter cooked up high and perfect!  To avoid problems de-panning it: make sure you use the toothpick test and also touch the top to make sure it springs back.  If you take it out too soon, you'll have a wet mess.  And follow the instructions and let it sit AT LEAST 10 minutes before de-panning it.  The frosting was an amazing consistency!  Creamy and easy to work with.  Add a little extra milk if it is not creamy enough and alternate the milk/cocoa/sugar as recommended.  I measured the 10X sugar per the recipe, but then added it a little at a time \"to taste.\"  I ended up with about a half cup of 10X left.  If you split the layers, you will have sufficient frosting.  I did not split the layers and had a ton leftover.  This cake was UNBELIEVABLE.  Moist, dense cake - not too sweet - and creamy delicious frosting.  I made it the day before a party and covered it tightly and it was perfect the next day.  Better than bakery cake.  Better than any chocolate cake I have ever had!!!  My guests' eyes were rolling back into their heads, this cake was THAT good.  This doesn't get 5 stars, it gets 10!!",

        "reviewBody": "This recipe is nearly identical to a recipe I have been using for 20 years. The only difference is that my recipe calls for 1 cup of cold water and 1 cup of piping hot coffee in place of the milk and boiling water. This time, I tried it with the milk and hot coffee, and I loved the result. There are 2 tricks to getting the layers out of the pan intact. The first is to use the right kind of pan. I use extra-heavy Wilton 9\" round cake pans. They have slightly higher sides than conventional cake pans and they are made of pale aluminum with a dull finish. This helps the cake cook evenly, but it also ensures that the cake develops a crust flexible enough to withstand turning the cake out onto the cooling racks. The second trick is to grease the pan heavily and then flour it. A light wipe with a greasy paper towel might make the flour stick, but it won't be enough to keep the cake from sticking to the pan. I lied. There is a third trick. Turn the cake out onto a cooling rack precisely 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven. That gives the cake time to firm up a bit, but not enough time for the shortening you used to grease the pan to adhere to the cake. And yes, the recipe yields a soupy batter. It's supposed to be that way. Don't use a springform pan. If your cake overflows the pan, you are probably using dutch process cocoa instead of regular unsweetened cocoa powder or a premium cocoa. Don't. You need the acidity of Hershey's regular to offset all that baking soda.",

The secret is to bake and frost this cake one day ahead of time. It's good/great the first day, but unbelievable the second day. I have also substituted part or all the regular unsweetened chocolate with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder when I make it for dark chocolate lovers. Hint: do NOT grease the sides of the pan so that your cake can \"climb\" up the sides. Your cake will bake level without puffing in the middle and you wont have to cut off the hump to level it. Just run a very sharp knife around the outside of the pan when fully baked and cooled for 15-20 minutes and remove it. This method gives you more crumbs on the sides, but a much nicer shaped cake. You can control the crumbs when you frost  by \"dirty icing\" the cake. To dirty ice, split the layers horizontally and place back together with icing in between each layer. Then, frost the whole cake with a very thin layer of icing  to \"cement\" the crumbs. Wait a few minutes for the dirty icing layer to harden slightly, then frost the cake.",

I have also made this recipe into an ice cream cake and it worked wonderfully. Just remember not to overbake it. For an ice cream cake, pour batter into 2 identical springform pans. Bake as directed, coolcompletely, then slice in half horizontally so you have 4 cake layers. Then place the bottomlayer back in the springform pan, top with softened ice cream, anotherlayer ofcake, more ice cream, another cake, more ice cream, then cake! Takes about a half gallon of ice cream. Freeze completely, prob overnight, open sides of pan. Then I ice a thin layer, put back in freezer for an hour or so, then frostcake as usual! Store in freezer until right before serving! It's been a hit several times over!",

Vanilla whipped cream would be a great accompaniment. Unaccompanied, it's nice but a little too plain.\r\n\r\nCaution: grease the pan quite well, as the cake is clingy when hot and you don't want to tear it.",

        "reviewBody": "I have made this cake recipe for every family birthday for the last 4 or 5 years. I have 4 children so I know this recipe off by heart now! It is a little crumbly but I make it the day before and put it in the fridge. This seams to change it into a very moist cake. I consider this a good thing because then I always have the cake ready ahead of time. It does stick in your pans terribly so be sure to line your pans with baking paper (or parchment) and not just butter or butter and flour them. This is a really delicious cake. I would make something different for each birthday but my husband and kids ask for this chocolate cake every time. Now if they would only learn the recipe and make it on my birthday.....ha ha.",

        "reviewBody": "Thanks so much for the recipe! I've made this cake twice to rave reviews. I almost didn't try it because of the warnings about its dryness from other users. If you are getting a dry cake from this recipe I believe it could be a technical issue. Insufficient creaming of the butter and sugar could cause the cake to be dry. I allow at least 2 minutes of moderate-speed blending. I also used butter-flavored Crisco (1c butter = 1c Crisco 6t water) which can also make it moister. You could also be overbaking either by giving it too much time in the oven or by having an oven that's too hot. If you enjoy baking do yourself a favor and invest 6.00 in an oven thermometer. You won't regret it!",

Topped it with cream cheese frosting (8 oz + 1 c powdered sugar, milk and Vanilla). Very good. Made it in a 9 x 13, baked it for about 35 minutes. It was a very thick cake, but not too dense and went over very well. Not as chocolate as I would have hoped for tho but a nice alternative from scratch.",

I don't change the ingredients, but I DO change the method, so if anyone is interested I will describe.  I grease and flour two 9in cake rounds.  Sift all of the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl.  Add the wet ingredients, and stir with a spoon until it's combined.  The vinegar will bubble with the baking soda.. it's supposed to.  The batter will be thin, but that's normal from what I can tell.  Although the recipe calls for a 13x9, when I baked it in that pan it took much longer than called for.  In the two 9in rounds, 30 minutes is perfect.  The cake is moist and there is ABSOLUTELY NO Vinegar taste.. AT ALL.  If you want a super duper chocolatey flavor, replace 1c of the water with coffee.  I know it sounds weird, but you won't taste the coffee.. only enhanced chocolate.  I'm no expert, but like I said.. every time I prepare the cake with this method, it is perfect.",

He also couldn't eat vinegar or chocolate, so Amatullah's suggestion about the orange cake conversion was great.  I substituted the cocoa with cornstarch and the vinegar with orange juice, and I added a teaspoon of orange zest.  I also exchanged the baking soda for baking powder.  It turned out perfectly!  If you're making the orange cake, I would suggest frosting it with Adora Marchi's \"Mom's Buttercream Frosting,\" sprinkling a pinch of lemon zest over the frosting, and putting a slice of fresh orange on top.  Be sure to cool the cake completely before applying the frosting.  Thanks Amy and Amatullah; you made my father's birthday very memorable.",

I also used half of Hershey s Dark cocoa as well as regular unsweetened cocoa. Using the cake as a base I added the following loosely following another recipe: Once cake cooled I poked holes into each cake using a long tined fork then poured a mix of cherry juice and slight amount of brandy onto each cake. Then I used a mix of.5 cup creamed butter.3 cup of /granulated sugar and almond extract to make a buttercream filling and put a layer on one of the cakes. I put one can of cherry pie filling (excluding juice) on that same cake then topped with slightly sweetened heavy whipping cream. I put the other cake on top then laid another can of cherry pie filling sans juice on top followed with more whipped cream. I used 2 cups of liquid heavy whipping cream when I made the cream for the middle and top of cake which was perfect. I had one slice right away and while it was good thought it was missing something but didn t know what. The cherries were somehow boring as well. The next day somehow it was wonderful! It was very moist and the flavors were enhanced. I originally thought the buttercream was a waste of time; however each day that passes (day 3 now) the filling flavor comes out more and really makes this cake! I will definitely use this recipe for any chocolate cakes I make from now on!",

        "reviewBody": "Fantastic fudgey, moist cake. I love it for two reasons -- it's versatile and easy, it even works in a high-altitude area, like Denver where I live. I use white whole wheat flour (King Arthur and Wheat Montana sell a white spring kernel variety, which is lighter and sweeter than regular whole wheat, but just as nutritious), and it still tastes like regular chocolate cake. Also, I can trim the fat without it tasting low-fat.I replace 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the oil with applesauce or mashed pear (use a small hole grater on an apple if you don't have any applesauce). I've made this recipe three times now, and when I'm not being health-conscious, I love it with chocolate glaze. I make a quick one with cocoa powder (mix 2 TBS oil, 2 TBS melted butter, 2TBS Karo syrup, 2 tsp vanilla, 6 TBS cocoa powder, 1.5 cups powdered sugar and 1/2 cup milk or more depending on your desired consistency).",

Thanks a gain for the terrific recipe and new family favorite. P. S. My husband is very finicky about vegetables even when they're in breads or cakes and he really loves this cake.",

And instead of using all, all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup of all-purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat. I also cut the sugar in half because the applesauce is sweet so that would make up for some of the missing sugar and then I added a tsp of vanilla. Anyway, when I brought this cake to my friends birthday party, everybody raved about it! Even my friend who hates all vegetables and fruits LOVED it (she still doesn't know that it was a zucchini cake because I haven't told her yet). AWESOME cake :)",

We all agreed that 1 cup was just right - too much more would have resulted in a dense greasy cake. No need to use applesauce for some of the oil either. This cake was perfectly moist with just 1 cup of oil. We also left out the nuts which was just fine. I used olive oil as I do with most of my baking and it was great. We all agreed the cake tasted better room temp the next day rather than warm out of the oven. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",

One tip, which made this even easier to make: I used seedless raspberry jam instead of cooking the raspberries on the stove. I just microwaved 6 tablespoons of jam for 30 seconds before adding to the cheesecake. It was so much easier and tasted fantastic! I also microwaved the white chocolate with half-and-half with excellent results. I will definitely make this again! Everyone was so impressed!",

If you're using smashed up Oreos for your chocolate cookie crumbs (which is what I do), then you don't need anywhere near as much butter or sugar in the crust; the Oreo creamy filling provides lots of sweetness and stick-it-together-ness.  I use 2 cups crushed Oreos, only one tablespoon sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter -- the crust comes out perfect that way.  Also, I'm not sure if I just have delinquently leaky springform pans or what, but the first time I made this, I ended up with melted butter dripping down from the bottom of the pan all over the bottom of my oven (quite a mess).  Now I put a jelly roll pan on the oven shelf below to catch the dripping butter, and all is well.  :-)  I have ended up with a few cracks in the top of the cheesecake each time I have made this, but once I pile on tons of white chocolate shavings/curls, no one is the wiser!  This cheesecake absolutely could NOT taste better -- people go CRAZY over it.",

Everyone who tried the last one said it was better than my mom's cheesecake... and that's saying a ton! \n\nA couple things though.. make sure you check it 15 minutes early. If it looks done in the over it will be OVER DONE on your plate! Tap the side of the pan with a spoon and if it jiggles as \"one piece\" rather than like jello, it's done. if it doesn't jiggle at all it's over done. \n\nAnd, If you're using a springform pan, you can put prachment paper on the bottom and it will just slide off the pan easly when it's time to cut it. \n\nAnd as for cutting perfect, clean pieces - run a clean, long, thin knife under hot water. Quickly dry it off with a towell and slice straight down and out. Repeat for EVERY SLICE! Yes, it will take a while - but you'll have beautiful, perfect slices. ^_^",

The first time i made it, I too, had a lot of trouble getting the raspberry seeds out which made the \"raspberry swirl\" almost non-existent, however, it tasted wonderful. The SECOND time I made it, I made just a few changes. I made it in a 10\" springform pan, and used 4 cups of white chocolate chips to give it extra white chocolate flavor. I also doubled the water to make the raspberry sauce and added 3.5 tablespoons of sugar, which made it drain out and taste wonderfully! I will always make it like that now, and encourage everyone to try this recipe no matter how they make it, or what alterations they make!",

        "reviewBody": "I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday and it was heavenly! It has a creamy texture with undertones of white chocolate and raspberry. My sister-in-law said it tasted \"professional.\" I doubled the crust using 2 cups of Oreo cookies, 1/4 cup of butter and 1 T. of sugar. Double the raspberry sauce. It's easier to puree the raspberries with the sugar, press the ingredients through a fine-mesh stainer and then cook it. I added 6 T. of raspberry sauce to the cake without it overpowering the taste. The white chocolate and half-and-half can be safely microwaved on HI for 1 minute, stirred throroughly, microwaved and stirred thoroughly. 2-1/2 to 3 minutes should do it. To prevent any leakage, I use a 9\" x 3\" cake pan.  Spray the bottom with Pam, add parchmant paper to the bottom and spray the parchmant. Cook the cheesecake in a water bath for the designated time. Remove from the water bath, carefully loosen the sides of the cake with an offset cake knife, then immediately refrigerate - uncovered - until morning. Never a crack. To remove the cake from the pan, heat water to almost boiling and gently dip the pan in (about 1\") for 10 seconds. Turn the pan over on a large flat plate, tap the bottom and lift the pan away from the cake. Invert cake onto serving plate. If cake stays in pan, repeat the process. The cheesecake will not fall. I always do this with excellent results.",

It's like the raspberry sauce had soaked into it. On top it looked beautiful (see picture) so I was very surprised that it didn't hold its texture well. I served it at a guild function and there wasn't one \"swoon\" which these ladies do for great decadent desserts. Not one request for the recipe which is always the usual course of things (as a chef I hate being asked to give out recipes. It's like asking a doctor to give out free prescriptions. But with this recipe I didn't have to worry - no requests.) It tasted fine though nothing spectacular. The white chocolate cannot even be tasted especially disappointing since I used expensive imported Belgian white chocolate. I shouldn't have bothered. I've made many other cheesecakes including just straight ones with no specialty flavorings that were much better. I'm a chef and have worked extensively as a caterer and pastry chef so no rookie here. As cheesecakes go this was merely OK. Not bad but certainly not exceptional. I know that flies in the face of all the other glowing reviews but I'm being completely honest. At best I'd describe this as aggressively mediocre.",

This cake turned out GREAT, and my friend was very complimentary of it!  Since a mixer part was missing in action, we did all the mixing and beating by hand, and it still turned out just fine.  It was very moist, had great shape and texture, and looked beautiful after adding the chocolate drizzle. \r\n\r\nThe next time I make it, though, I will ADD TWO EXTRA OUNCES OF CHOCOLATE TO THE CAKE MIXTURE, to make it just a touch chocolate-ier.  Also, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE ONE AND A HALF RECIPES OF THE FILLING/FROSTING. One recipe of it would not be enough, and 1 1/2 is just right.  Also, TOAST THE COCONUT AND PECANS.  That makes them much, much better.  Be careful about burning the coconut.  It toasts very quickly.  A great cake that we will probably make a lot!  Well worth the trouble.",

        "reviewBody": "Upon researching for hours for a German Chocolate cake recipe worth the time to make and choosing this one, I bought the \"Bakers\" German sweet chocolate bar for use in this cake.  After opening the box of chocolate, there are recipes in there for frosting, cake and a few others using this chocolate.  Lo and behold the cake recipe they print is exactly the same as this one except this one says to use cake flour and 1/2 cup more of it.  Other than that it's exact.  I know this will be delicious as I've made this (the one off the box) years ago and it was awesome.  German Choc. cake is my all time favorite cake but is very time consuming to make by scratch so I don't make it often.  The frosting on the box is also worth the mention as there isn't one on this site that really stands out for such an exceptional cake.  It appears to resemble the Ger. Choc. cake frosting II on this site but it makes more which you would need for a proper 3 layer cake. I would suggest using the frosting recipe on the box and you won't be dissapointed. At least Dean knows his recipe for German Chocolate Cake!!",

        "reviewBody": "Great Cake! I read the reviews and agreed with these suggestions. It's a must to toast the coconut and pecans. A little salt to the icing would bring out the flavor better...so I added 1/4 teaspoon. I should mention that I mixed 1-1/2 times the icing recipe. I had no problem getting the icing to thicken, but it's important to bring your initial ingredients to a boil while stirring constantly. As soon as it starts to boil you can see it's thickening. Once it's cools and you add the coconut and pecans...it's plenty thick. I also put mine in the refrigerator to set up even better. The cake batter provides enough to more than fill 2- 9\" pans. Make sure you use CAKE flour not all purpose flour, it does make a difference. If you can't find cake flour, try bulk bins or go to your instore bakeries and ask them to sell you some. I found that the recipe produces too much batter and the cake rose over the edges of the pan and got crispy. ( not what you want on a cake )This also increases your baking time which is also what you do not want because it will make your cake drier. Next time I will remove 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter off each 9\" pan, that should make it perfect. The cake rises high and beautiful, I was very impressed! Lastly, I agreed that the cake was much better the next day..it got even more moist.I would make this cake the day before a special event to maximize the pleasure of this moist cake. I now believe I can make a cake from scratch with the moistness of a \"box\" cake! ..",

        "reviewBody": "I decided to make this cake for our anniversary after my husband told me that this was his favorite cake. This cake was very good light and moist. However I did follow the advice of others and made more filling. I used 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk 1 1/2 cups sugar 3/4 cup butter 4 slightly beated egg yolks 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla 2 1/3 cup coconut 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans and 2 tbsp. instant vanilla pudding. I followed the directions except I cooked on medium heat for about 12 minutes. The coconut and pecans were added after removing from heat. This made enough filling/frosting for between the layers and on top. Next time I will double Dean's recipe (adding the vanilla pudding and cooking on medium heat) so that I can have enough to frost the cake and omit the chocolate drizzle. We were not too crazy about that part.",

        "reviewBody": "I have made this cake for the cafe and my family over a hundred times now. You can make it as is and it is excellent or you can deviate. First word of advice: DO NOT FROST THE SIDES OR TOP OF THIS CAKE. It has a wonderful rustic look if you frost ONLY the internal layers. The chocolate topping is made with FAR too few squares of chocolate. Add extra and for each extra you add add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of shortening. I like to create a ganache shell on top of my cake so I pour chocolate there and spread it super thin then drizzle chocolate down the size. It gives it a beautiful rustic-artisan look. You can decorate the top of the cake by SPARINGLY sprinkling raw or toasted coconut (or chopped nuts) on top of the cake and then drizzling additional chocolate in a crisscross pattern over the top of that. Feel free to deviate in nuts you use - I often use hazelnuts along with pecans. I also often toast my coconut instead of using plain raw coconut. This will drastically change the flavors of the cake but it's always fun to deviate once in a while. Also when you make your layers place parchment paper on the bottom of your pans. Put the pan cake and all in the freezer until frozen. Place the bottom of the pan in hot water for about 10 to 20 seconds. This will warm the bottom of the cake. Remove the layers remove the parchment paper and cut the bulb off the top of each layer to make a perfectly round flat layer. This will increase presentability by 100%!",

Everything is the same except this recipe calls for 1/2 cup more flour(cake) and 1/4 teaspoon more salt. This recipe was ok not as moist flavorful or buttery as the recipe calling for 2 cups of flour. I did use cake flour recommended. I was quite disappointed and everyone said that my old recipe was so much better. i definitely agree. The chocolate color was not as intense (lighter brown) and cake tasted dry. I also toasted the pecans but I like the non toasted taste better for this cake. Will not try this recipe again but rather will stick by my old recipe. It is so much better. The frosting can be made the day before (used the recipe on the German chocolate bar). It is delicious ample enough to frost the entire cake.",

Used a devils food cake box 1/4 cup Godiva and 1/4 Kamora(just like Kahlua but 1/2 the price!) and only one cup of chocolate chips (mini is best but not essential). Used cocoa to dust the pan but you can also use a little of the chocolate cake mix if you don't have cocoa. Baked for 60mins. Had leftover chocolate ganache from a cake I made earlier in the week (that was WAY more work and not as good!) so poured that over the top and it looked stunning! Have been experimenting with different liquors every time I make this - Baileys Grand Marnier dark rum...My favorite liquor in this cake so far has been Chambord (raspberry) although Grand Marnier is very good too. FYI: Tia Maria Kahlua Kamora and Cafe Ole are all coffee flavored liquors (the last two being the cheapest). Godiva and Creme de Cacao are good for the chocolate flavored liquors. You could also make this non-alcoholic by using strong brewed coffee.",

I also used 1 cup of Irish cream flavored liquer which tastes much better and added more flavor. Have also substituted 2 tablespoon instant espresso powder in place of the liquer and was fantastic. Espresso really brings out the flavor of chocolate. Have also used Andes Mint Chocolate baking chips and it was to die for! Also use room temp. eggs which makes cake rise better. (If in a pinch soak cold eggs in very hot tap water for 5 min.) No need for glaze or frosting or this will be too sweet. Taste best with fresh strawberries/rasberries if available. If not dust with powdered sugar and you're good to go. So easy and taste very homemade!! TIP - You can use other cake mix flavors such as Vanilla and add the sour cream to make a moist dense yellow cake.",

        "reviewBody": "Incredible cake! I almost break out in hives at the thought of baking a BOXED cake...but I must give credit where it is due. I tried using one cup of chocolate chips at the suggestion of other reviewers and it's delicious. I prefer using the full 2 cups of mini chocolate chips though. I think it lends greatly to the gooey consistancy of the cake. Regular chocolate chips look like chips in cake...the minis seem to melt right in. I have also experimented with different liquors such as Kahlua and Godiva but try others for fun too. I think it's great with Bailey's which my husband liked but when I used my Aramula cream liqueur...he declared it the best chocolate cake in the world. It needs no icing...try a light dusting of powdered sugar for asthetics. Make sure you dust just before serving. This cake is so moist...the powdered sugar is quickly absorbed (and may look less than appealing). Also make sure you do flour the pan or use baker's joy. Once I only used oil and the cake didnt fall out as neatly.",

I used a can of dunkin hines vanilla frosting and with this the cake was good.  However, after mellowing in the fridge for a day or two this cake was insanely good!  As good as any store bought or boxed mix.  Bottom line:  Make the cake a day in advance and let it mellow in the fridge overnight.  I see no need to buy another boxed mix again.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh, and yes, after the water step it will be very soupy but it will turn out perfect :D",

You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing.",

The type of cocoa is crucial. I've cooked it twice first time used a dark cocoa it was good but the dark chocolate enhanced the salt so it tasted a tad salty. So next time if using a dark cocoa will omit the salt. Second time used good quality standard cocoa and came out great. Also used a diluted espresso instead of plain water. Also glad the writer noted the runniness of the mix abit worrying at first. Excellent recipe.",

For a point of reference, I have been buying the Trader Joe's flourless chocolate cake... this recipe is just as good if not better! I substituted 1/3C egg whites for two of the four eggs.  I also used  1/2 C milk chocolate chips and 1 C. semi sweet chips, and dusted the pan with unsweetened coco pwdr.

For all those reviewers who are giving this recipe 1/5 stars, you must NOT be following the recipe correctly.  It actually upsets me reading the negative reviews.  How is possible to be biting into a bean? You are supposed to be blending the beans into a smooth mixture via a food processor! How is it dry? The recipe calls for 4 eggs! Grainy? Again, mix via food processor to a smooth consistency and wash the beans thoroughly beforehand.  Not sweet enough or chocolately enough? Are you using the correct measuring spoons?! Anyone who follows this recipe to the exact T should be successful in making a delicious cake.  If you have a good quality food processor, a non stick baking pan, and you know how to read and follow instructions, this cake will turn out fantastic.  Good luck!",

        "reviewBody": "Great recipe.  Served it to 7 people & they all liked it.  My 12 year old daughter had 2 pieces.    I processed the beans ALOT & it was pretty smooth.  No one could taste the beans @ all but felt good about the fact that they were eating a dessert that was actually good for them.  We thought it was sweet enough, my sister in Law who is a health nut thought it was too sweet but she hates sweets altogether but it was fun to see her enjoying her cake & not feel guilty about it.  The only change I made was to put in more baking powder, added 1 tsp. vanilla and used brown sugar instead of white.  I will only add the stated amount of baking powder next time as I feel it will be better not being so airy.    The cake does look dry but then when eating it surprisingly it doesn't taste dry.  Kinda crumbly (but no one minded) so next time I will try adding some applesauce or butter or maybe even some Peanut butter.  Chocolate chips or chunks, nuts would also be good in it.    Really make sure by poking in the center as to when the cake is truly done.  Mine took longer to cook than stated.  This Recipe will be used over & over again, with variations as to additions and toppings, as a cake & as cupcakes. \n\nUPDATE Made it again, this time added toasted whole almonds as the food processor will chop them.  Added 1/3 cup applesauce  & a 1/4 cup coconut oil.  Wow it was perfect.  More fudgy tasting, less crumbly & the nutty bits were a nice treat.  Raspberries & dollop of cream on top perfect!",

I followed the recipe just as written on her blog and came out with a moist cupcake, slightly bitter filling, and a sweet buttercream that happily balanced out the ganache center.  I also went one step farther and mixed up a Bailey's Salted Caramel drizzle for the top and that took them over the top.  (For the drizzle, I used 1/2 cup caramel ice cream topping, a Tbsp of Bailey's, and salted it to taste. )  I'd definitely recommend making these!",

        "reviewBody": "So far folks love these...a perfect Patty's Day treat. A few notes on prep: FILLING: Melting chocolate is tricky business. Heat the cream slowly on low heat but make sure it is really simmering before adding the chocolate. If you end up with a chunky greasy mixture it means the chocolate didn't temper and you'll need to start over. FROSTING: I agree that the frosting as written isn't quite right and adding more Bailey's is not the best solution for making it fluffier. While it may seem like adding more confectioners sugar would stiffen it (like adding flour) it actually makes the frosting runnier. I increased the butter to 3/4 cup and it was perfect: both in quantity and in consistency.",

I just started getting into baking and these were very fun to make. One thing I learned is that these take a lot of time to make, especially if your a beginner.

I made the cupcakes exactly as written with modifications for our high altitude (over 5 000 ft.). The cupcakes were fantastic! The only thing that I might have done differently would be to increase the filling and frosting as I ran out of it before I had filled all of the cupcakes. I used the correct alcoholic mixture as well. FYI you can but small miniatures for the filling and frosting. Which is what I did. I also used good quality chocolate and cocoa for the recipe. These may take a while to make but they are truly awesome and worth all of the time involved. I also used my Wilton cupcake corer for the first time which may be why I needed extra filling. The corer once I figured it out made it easy to take out the extra cupcake material in the middle. I used the cupcake cores to make my Grandma Scherer's \"cake\". She could never get any cake to come out of the pan so she would crumble it up and fold it into whipped cream along with some fruit. I did the same with my middles adding dried cherries.",

I've only made the cake with 9 inch pans and there was barely enough batter for 2 layers so when I needed a larger cake I just doubled the recipe. I also make sure I make the frosting at least 1 night before I serve the cake because it takes some time for the sugar to fully dissolve but it is perfect the next day. I've also used white chocolate shavings to decorate the top of the cake and it makes it really classy professional looking. No one has to know that it started as a mix!",

To decorate I used hershey's hugs because of the brown and white stripes. It matched the inside and was a neat effect.",

I love oats so added an extra 1/4 cup. I subtracted a 1/4 cup flour to keep the dry measures the same. I only used whole wheat flour not all-purpose for part. This created a lovely brown bread. I used fennel seeds in place of the orange zest and I highly recommend this. Finally I realized at the last moment that I didn't have parchment paper so I greased my cast iron skillet and made one large loaf. My husband and I already ate half with dinner!",

Took a lot of work because the dough is so wet and sticky, getting it to set a little so I could handle it was a test of my patience.

However it is a delightful tasting bread...perfect for breakfast or brunch.  It tastes more like a moister scone!  I made it with all the listed ingredients except substituted steel cut oats for the rolled oats (steel cut oats are the secret ingredient for true Irish soda bread).  Can't say I really noticed them in this bread.  Also used 1/4 cup Craisens because that is what I had.  Baked the loaves for the time stated but did so in a metal roaster pan with parchment in the bottom.  Took off the lid to brown the last 10 minutes.  They were baked perfectly.  I bake my artisan bread in the roaster pan to keep them moist....works very well!",

I had to dust frequently with flour just to get it off the kneading surface and my hands. So I probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. That is why it has a 3 star rating. On the upside I loved the flavor and especially the orange zest that sets it apart from other soda breads. The texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I might make this again...and maybe decreased the buttermilk.",

Just as described the crust had an amazing buttery taste and was simple to make. I was able to roll the dough out without any additional flour on my board or rolling pin. I left out one star because even though I rolled the dough a bit thinner than 1/4 inch I still did not have enough dough to make a pretty thickly crimped edge on either of the two pies I made. Next time I will make a recipe and a half to make crusts for two pies. When the recipe says it make two pie crusts I wish it would specify the size of the pie plate. I didn't think mine were that big but I guess that must be the problem.",

Also we didn't have time to put the dough back into the refrigerator. The apple mixture was made ahead of time and we spooned it onto our dough and followed the instructions for sealing the tarts. We used 7\" glass pie dishes ungreased and put two tarts in each dish back to back. After baking they slid out of the dishes just fine. Oh what a lovely taste! I am officially abandoning my grandmother's excellent pastry recipe for this one instead.",

First: Pat dry the pickle slices. Second: coat both sides of the sandwich with the mayo/mustard sauce completely, but keep it a thin layer. Third: Rinse the barbecue sauce  off the precooked pulled pork I used and pat it dry.  I had a problem with the sandwich toppings oozing out of the sides when I compressed it.  I'm thinking the drier it is on the inside going into the pan, the less will ooze out during cooking.  (It was still yummy!) Thanks, Chef!!",

Use lowest flame possible and continually move and adjust the height of the pan over the flame, wisking constantly.  DO NOT place pan directly down on the stove. Watch very carefully because it thickens quickly once up to temp. See Chef John's video on this open flame method on this site.  I personally like to use just one teaspoon of lemon juice.\n    For a quick béarnaise sauce try adding a few drops of balsamic or red wine vinegar along with some tarragon, parsley, onion powder and fresh ground pepper.",

        "reviewBody": "The recipe as directed works fine. In fact you don't even need cold butter room-temperature is fine. When you start to whisk you'll get a million lumps of butter but as soon as they melt just keep going and you're good. The main criticism I'd give is that \"low heat\" could mean anything. Depending on your temperature this might take 15 minutes. IF IT \"DOESN'T THICKEN \" it will. Just keep going. If it's still as juicy as at the start at the five minute mark increase the heat just a tick but not much. And once it's thick it won't separate. \"Real\" Hollandaise has bay mince shallot maybe parsley and thyme and 50/50 mix of vinegar and water. I actually like a \"fast\" way to make it as well. But why not tear up a bay leaf and add it to the mix along with some onion powder and white pepper if you have it.",

I used one box of the Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts which made about 11 pies using a 3 inch star shaped cookie cutter. I was able to cut out 8 stars on each sheet then balled up the dough and rolled it out again. The filling is absolutely delicious! The little hand pies turned out great and were super easy to make. My kids loved them and I like how using the cookie cutters makes a nice dessert portion size. Definitely would make again!",

The only fruit I had in the house was one nectarine but I remembered that green tomatoes could be used when you don't have enough apples so I used one large nectarine and two small green tomatoes for the filling. The only other thing I changed was to substitute vanilla for some of the cinnamon. My gas oven runs a little hot so they turned out a little brown but so delicious! I will definitely be making this again!",

I am glad I listened to my common sense. I usually like spicy food but wish I had reduced the peppers even more. If you want to try this recipe start with 1/4 the amount of ground peppers it calls for and then add more if you like. I wonder if all the rave reviews came from people who do not have these particular spices in their cabinet so they substituted a milder chili powder.",

I made a few changes--I didn't have chipotle or ancho chile powder on hand so I used a generic chili powder blend and threw a couple adobo chipotle peppers in with the spices deseeded and chopped. I added a little cinnamon and just a dash of cloves because I think they play with the other flavors well and add a hint of complexity. This is a keeper. It's quick it's cheap it's delicious and if you have a 3 quart skillet it only uses one pan. A perfect dinner to spice up the middle of the week. No pun intended honestly.",

I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Oops A little more cayenne pepper! Lots of cilantro for garnish. It was fabulous! Everyone loved it. It took a long time to make but was worth it.

When I cook I try to reach a happy medium that will satisfy both of us. I was nervous about the amount of chili powder in this recipe so I started with just half the amount. Turns out even that was way too much and hubby agreed. I trust his judgement when he says it s overkill. The saving grace for this recipe is the toppings. The sour cream cools it down and the fresh cilantro and green onions gives it much needed flavor. Suffice to say we did not skimp with the toppings!",

As long as you cook the meat long enough, and season thoughtfully, there's really no way this sauce isn't going to be great. So, while you may not have grown up in an Italian-American home, with this comforting sauce simmering on the stove every Sunday, your family still can. Serve the sauce over pasta and top with the tender meat.",

I brown in a dutch oven and then brown my tomato paste a bit and add my San Marzano after deglazing the pan with wine. Plenty of garlic is the key!

My mom made it for us many years ago to use up roast beef (and probably lamb or other roasts) and I recall her grinding the cooked meat but I just chopped it up.  I used olive oil and regular onion as that was what I had.  I didn't have the proper salsa but served it with ketchup like my mom did.  Delish!!  It brought back good memories, too. Thank you for the recipe.  Next time I'll try it with the salsa.",

        "reviewBody": "These scones were very good. I enjoyed the video and Chef John's sense of humor.  I made them as outlined in the recipe.  I much prefer to read reviews that are made as outlined. When you change things without having made the original first, you're not really giving an accurate review. As far as I know, there is no true way to make scones. Not unless you invented them. I've been making scones for my husband for over 40 years and we enjoy the many different takes on scones. We do like currants in the scones and we usually eat them after dinner for dessert instead of in the morning.  This is a very good recipe which I will make again and added it to my huge collection of scone recipes. Thank you Chef John!",

I ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and I would have added just a little bit more sugar (not too much since scones shouldn't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries I used). With those adjustments though it's a great recipe! Very authentic and delicious! The center is moist but it's got a nice crusty outside. Like other reviewers said it's so versatile! I might try lemon or candied ginger next time.",

Broth is so much better when made with rotesserie ckn. Pretty much followed the recipe & added trimmings at the end.  Great way to use up rotisserie ckn & get a bigger bang for your buck. Your only expense is the price of the veggies & if you're like me you have them in the fridge anyways. A pot of soup for no extra cost!  If I'm not going to serve right away I cook the noodles separate.  If they're left in overnite they tend to swell & absorb the broth.  So I just toss them in when I'm reheating the soup.",

I don't have an oven proof pot so I placed the rice mixture in a 13x9 pan, arranged the chicken pieces on top, covered tightly with foil and baked for just under an hour.  (Brown rice takes a lot longer to cook than white.)  Smelled so good while it was baking, we couldn't wait to dig in.  We loved the wonderful blend of flavors in this chicken and rice dish!",

I used black olives instead of green as that's what I had on hand an did not include the capers as I was out. I also used 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of two due to the overwhelming media coverage on reducing sugar intake as of late (sigh). Overall easy and tasty. The 6 year old found it a bit spicy but she is catching on to our table flavors nicely and did manage to eat at least the chicken bits. The presentation is lovely; when you remove the lid at the table all of the chicken is nicely presented on top of the rice combination and smells just wonderful. Thanks Chef John!",

The green olives and capers give it an interesting slightly salty flavor so you might want to cut back on the added salt. Cumin was the predominant flavor. If you don't like cumin cut back on it but I wouldn't eliminate it altogether. The chicken was done through but not overcooked. If you watch Chef John's video you will notice that he uses less than a whole onion. Some of his other ingredients were less than what the recipe calls for. And he does not include the back pieces of the chicken. I did because I like those bony parts. All-in-all a good recipe and worth repeating. We are looking forward to leftovers since there only two of us and it makes a lot.",

I doubled the entire recipe (except the butter because that adds too much fat) I used 25% less sodium chicken broth and just 1-2 tablespoons of LIGHT butter. Instead of the chipotle seasoning I used what another person had commented (1/2tsp paprika 1/8tsp crushed red pepper and a dash of chilli powder and it worked out great. A little heat but not too much.) There was no left overs and I will be making this again! Save the calories/salt/fat where you can! =)",

I made it with a slight variation - did not have cayenne pepper and used paprika and did not have parsley so left it out but it was all good at the end and very surprised with the taste it gave. Only warning is that the mushroom while sautéing may release heaps and heaps of water and would affect cooking the fish - may need to consider sautéing the mushrooms until all the liquids have evaporated.",

        "reviewBody": "Fabulous recipe Chef! This is the way fried chicken should be made. I had to make acidified buttermilk (1 tablespoon of lemon juice per 1 cup of milk allow to curdle for 10 minutes) but the preparation to me was effortless. Unfortunately I didn't have enough oil for my dutch oven so I used my skillet turn the chicken over once after 10 minutes cooking for 25 minutes total. Also I only had corn oil. I'll try peanut oil next time. Thanks again!",

This is not the BEST fried chicken I have had, but it was tasty and nice and crispy. I did not need 2 cups of buttermilk, so just pour in as much as you need to cover the chicken good. The rest of the ingredients I used the same. I used about 2 inches of oil to fry in and let it get good and brown.",

Of course I knew fried chicken was high fat but seeing it print detered me from making it. I decided to use the ingredients and make oven fried chicken. I use all the ingredients except the oil. After coating the chicken with the seasoned flour I sprayed it with PAM. I used a non stick baking pan. The results were wonderful!!",

I doubled all the spices and seasonings (except salt which I kept the same). The end result was perfectly flavorful which to me means that it would have been bland with the written amounts. Also I cooked the chicken between 275 and 300 degrees and they were perfectly brown at 19 minutes cook time. The breasts were slightly dry they should have been taken out earlier. The dark pieces were amazing though.",

However, I put the chicken in a 325 degree oven with the rack over a lipped cookie sheet and baked for 1/2 hour instead of the second frying.  It removed a lot of the grease.

Follow Chef John's advice and you will be a Southerner in no time. I used Italian panko bread crumbs and added one additional egg white to the two whole eggs and milk station. Please make sure you let them set for 10 to 15 minutes once breaded as I believe it makes all the difference. Also make sure to follow the step regarding drawing out the water from the tomato slices. The remoulade sauce puts this dish over the top. Liked the movie loved the dish.",

I also used coconut oil to fry them in beforehand. I chose green beans for the veg and they were great. I also used a popular curry paste. Making it again tonight. I will be using a green curry paste this time. And cod and shrimp instead of chicken. I will also include Sweet potato with the green beans. Because we like it hot and the kiddo does not I make the curry sauce saving about a cup. I blend this with the jalapeños and heat in a small pan separately. When serving we just add a big spoonful of this superheated sauce for heat and flavor.",

I didn't increase any other of the ingredients and it was plenty of sauce. Unfortunately I didn't have any fresh cilantro so I substituted a tsp of dried coriander. My super picky 8 year old even asked for seconds! After the chicken legs were gone I cubed a few sweet potatoes and a pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts and made a soup using the remaining sauce. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I followed the recipe pretty much all the way except: I used 4 legs and 4 thighs (still had plenty of sauce) my store didn't have Thai basil so I had to use regular. What I'd change: we like it spicy so I'm going to leave the seeds in 1 or 2 of the jalapeños more ginger (I wish the amount noted in the recipe was more specific) I'd change nothing else. The sweet potato and eggplant were delightful. I'm going to try this with beef next time. Definitely a keeper",

I couldn't find McCormick's red curry powder so I used a tablespoon of red curry paste (Mae Ploy brand) and I didn't add any basil leaves. For veg I used 2 white potatoes a can of baby corn brown mushrooms and sliced red pepper. I used cane sugar just because. I'll make this again the sauce is such a good base. I served it with jasmine rice. I think next time I'll use chicken breast or chicken thighs. Just a preference because even after crisping it it ended up soggy in the final product and I don't enjoy picking skin out of my bowl.",

I also change out the veggies - I don't love eggplant. Use veggies that won't get soggy like a mixture of carrots potatoes green beans broccoli variety of peppers asparagus etc. You can substitute ginger powder for the fresh ginger if needed but I prefer the fresh. Once this is done cooking and ready to serve I add either sour cream OR greek yogurt (add either to taste) to the sauce and heat just enough to serving temperature - - - it helps slightly with the flavor and makes it a lot less runny.",

I also put a dollop of Greek yogurt on top just before serving.  Next time I make this I'm going to add some dried oregano with the egg mixture so it will have a Greek flavor.

I followed the recipe as far as ingredients, but since I don't have a saute pan I can put in the oven I piled everything into a quiche pan (10 1/2\" diameter;  2\" height).  It was therefore not as thin as in a large saute pan, so took longer to set (approx 30 minutes).  I also really don't like runny eggs, so the 30 minutes let it set all the way through and was a little browned on top without broiling, but without making the eggs tough.  I will definitely make this again.  I could easily cut this into 1\" pieces to make appetizers, too.",

I followed the recipe and method with the exception of finely chopping the jalapeno pepper.  I did this is a heavy duty wok - really high heat and didn't have to spoon off any extra liquid from the chicken.  I didn't need half of the marinade either.  I used a large spoon and spooned a couple of spoonfulls of the marinade around the edge of the very hot wok  - so the liquid would immediately come to a boil and thicken quickly.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Enjoy!",

For us it s hard to beat orange chicken when well prepared by a fine Chinese restaurant as the flavor of the sauce is absorbed and clings to the battered fried chicken. This dish eliminates the batter and oil for cooking the chicken which reduces some fat and calories. We were very pleased with the outcome and thought this dish delivered a savory balance of sweet and spicy flavors. We will make this again.",

I will use the habanero again for this recipe I think it is a more flavorful heat than jalapeno. Will get green onions next time for more texture/flavor. It tastes like Chinese take-out orange chicken minus the calorific batter around the chicken and it is truly non-greasy!!! Loved it!!! But I am taking 1 star off because the recommended length of cooking the chicken made it dry and overcooked. But I will make it again when I have a hankering for Chinese food without the extra calories.",

I thought the amount of ginger overpowered the orange flavor so I would cut the amount at least in half. I also think I would cut down slightly on the brown sugar. And I thought the sauce was too thin so next time I would thicken it slightly with a little cornstarch dissolved in a little water. I think the recipe has potential to be a four with these changes.",

I'm a little bit of a wuss but my husband isn't and even he found it hot enough which he usually doesn't. Next time I'll use 1/2 the jalapenos take my portion out of the pan add the other 1/2 and give it to Mr. I can eat anything. The other thing is the cooking times are all a bit long. Use your judgment. Finally sorry Chef John but I don't like to add my snow pea pods that early. I added them with the jalapenos at the end. I like them quite crispy and just heated through. My version came out a bit darker than in the video but it was delicious and a definite keeper.",

I followed the recipe exactly right up to the point where you would return the rolls to the pan with the gravy to simmer on the stove until done. Since I was cooking 8 fairly large rolls I put them in a roaster, poured the gravy over them (I made enough to cover them almost completely), covered the roster with foil, and baked at 350 degrees for 90 minutes. When they were done I skimmed the grease (there was a lot), put the gravy back in the pan I browned them in, and thickened it with a little slurry of flour and beef broth. The ONLY thing I might change next time is maybe going with thinner dill spears our cutting it down to 2 per roll. I will without a doubt be making this again!",

Yes it takes a while but you can reasonably break down tasks simultaneously. So that not much prep time is needed and much of your dishes and waste are already dealt with before the meal is prepared. This meal was incredible. It's better than most restaurants. I used a stock pot for the first step and a dutch oven for steps three through six. In hindsight I wish I had used chicken broth instead of water in step one. Even without I am telling you this stew is incredible. The combination of herbs is good. One set of herbs (tarragon rosemary herbes de Provence) reminds me a little of absinthe for some reason while the others added plenty of spiciness. I highly recommend this meal. It deserves WAY more reviews. It is spicy hot as some noted but not overly so. If one doesn't want it they could probably leave out the cayenne pepper. I think the cayenne pepper makes it perfect however.",

Only a few things I did to make this simpler: One I baked chicken breasts in the oven and used store bought chicken stock and two I did not cook the stew for 45 min. I let it cook just until the carrots were tender. The fresh herbs make this!! Oh I baked it in a 9x13 pan and split the biscuits in half so that they cooked through faster. DEEEEEELISH!!!!!!",

The last time I was around someone using this much pepper they were heavy smokers and their taste buds were zilched. Start out by reducing the pepper asked to 1/2 or 1/3 and increase or reduce it from there next time. If you try to rush the dish and not let it simmer to thicken then it will turn out very runny. I substitute frozen bisquits and they work out just fine and I like the flavor better than canned biscuits.",

I am not one for spicey foods but I still loved this. Next time I will tone it down with the peppers. I think it is a must to use all the spices otherwise you will lose some of the flavor. I cannot wait to make this again. I should mention I don't own a dutch oven so those like me can use a stock pot and then throw it all in a roaster when it is time to place in the oven. Works just the same. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!",

Also the dressing just runs to the bottom of the bowl the noodles didn't soak up the dressing even after having sat in the refrigerator overnight. (Another reviewer suggested some peanut butter in the dressing which is an excellent idea.) It is a difficult salad to plate and eat with the noodles being so long - I would break up the noodles a little before soaking them. I did serve this with grilled chicken but I used the recipe for Shoyu Chicken for the marinade for the chicken.",

I made as is but for one thing: I substituted diced green peppers for the green onions as my Boo hates onions but I put them on the side with some extra crushed peanuts so that people could add garnish to their own salads. This one is definitely a keeper. (BTW Trader Joe's has pre-shredded carrots which makes it even EASIER!).",

I find that tossing the noodles in the dressing them laying them out on a cookie sheet topped with the veggies makes mixing everything together well much easier.

I love Asian food but I've never used fish sauce before and I was a bit apprehensive. However all of the flavors work together perfectly. Don't be afraid! I think this salad is going to be in heavy rotation this summer at my house. I will say the rice noodles took forever to soften just sitting in hot water so I ended up boiling them and then hitting them with cold water and it was fine.",

Second I had some Campbell's tomato juice cans and it worked out fine. Third I added in a dew additional spices I thought would go well into the mix ( personal preference ). Finally the review that suggested the microwave for the cabbage leaves was awesome. Put the cabbage in a small casserole and added enough water to cover the bottom with about a quarter inch of water. Scored and stabbed into the core of the cabbage. 2 minutes at a time and the leaves came of intact. I didn't burn off my fingers as happens when I boil the cabbage and water gets trapped between the leaves. Nothing like unexpected scalding to put you off enjoying dinner. Finally used the cooking liquid to create a thicker sauce to drizzle.",

        "reviewBody": "I found a way to make EVERYONE happy! I made 1 1/2 recipes. With half of the mix I used pepper jack cheese blue cheese dressing and a scant 1/4C blue cheese crumbles. With the other I used cheddar/jack cheese ranch dressing and 1 tsp. of powdered ranch dressing mix. Served them side by side with some blue cheese crumbles to spoon on top as they chose. I did use low or reduced fat ingredients where I could but that's my personal take. HINT: Blue cheese can be pricey and extras spoil if you don't use it frequently. I always buy the amount I need at the salad bar in my local grocery. It's less expensive by the pound there and I don't end up with a lot of leftovers to worry about wasting.",

I am one who does definitely prefer bleu cheese to ranch on my buffalo style wings but it seems that not everyone has my good taste! The bleu cheese taste was a bit strong however but that may be because of the dressing that I use which is Bob's Big Boy brand. It is a very rich dressing. I may temper it by halving the bleu cheese dressing and adding in some ranch next time. Not sure. Anyway 5 stars because I loved it and I'm sure that it can be made a little less potent so as to please most everyone.",

I was hoping that 1) this would be close to what we grew up on and 2) that it would be phenomenal due to it being one of Chef John's recipes but after all the work to make it (no modifications other than used gluten free AP flour) and the resulting flavor I am disappointed. My husband said he would not want me to make it again and really I don't have any desire to. I served it over GF biscuits (figured toasted bread like in childhood was too plain for a meal that took this long to make). I really don't know what would make it be five stars. I guess I'll keep looking.",

If you're using the recipe in burritos as we did, it's perfect as the other ingredients mellow out the heat.  If I were making it for tacos or another recipe that it was more front and center, I would reduce the amount of peppers by 1 or 2.  All that being said, we made burritos with rice, beans and cheese and then topped each one with a bit of the sauce and some more cheese and tossed them under the broiler for a minute and it was truly amazing.  Served it with a side of shredded lettuce, tomato,  onions and fresh guacamole and garnished with fresh cilantro and cotija cheese . Far better than anything you can get at a restaurant.",

I d say I almost followed the recipe except I deseeded my chipotles only had white onion on hand doubled the oregano and I ended up adding some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also cut time by using my instant pot my chicken went in frozen for 20 mins. Every picky person (I usually make multiple meals) in my home complemented this. We didn t find this to be too spicy after removing the seeds. I have a 9yo and a FIL w/heartburn issues and I got no complaints.

It's a bit ironic that all these years later, I'm using chicken breast to create a Buffalo wing alternative, but at least I'm not trying to trick anybody. Less messy than bone-in Buffalo wings and more eventful than the 'boneless' kind, these Buffalo chicken egg rolls are a party snack breakthrough. Serve alongside more hot sauce and celery.",

        "reviewBody": "Chef John, I'd like to meet you some day and give you a big ol' hug!  I love the way you cook.  I made this for my boys and everyone was amazed by how good it was.  And for such a simple dish, it had a really complex flavor that knocked all our socks off!\nThe recipe is versatile enough to accommodate what you have on hand, or for your personal tastes.  I didn't have fish sauce, so I substituted with about a teaspoon of anchovy paste in 1/3 cup soy sauce.  The fresh jalapeno didn't appeal to me, so instead, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes.  The key ingredients for the sauce are the soy/fish sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, garlic and ginger.  If you start there and add/subtract what you like/don't like, this will always be a hit.\nFor those of you who had trouble getting the sauce to thicken; this dish must be cooked on high heat for the entire cooking time in order to achieve the right caramelization on the chicken and to get the sauce to reduce.  I used the entire amount of water called for and my reduction took between 10-15 minutes.  The sauce will bubble and foam.  That's ok.  That's what you're looking for to get it to reduce.  Don't be afraid of how hard it boils.  Let it do what it do!!!\nDO NOT USE BREAST MEAT!  Boneless, skinless thighs can withstand the high temperatures required to make this dish.  Breast meat will dry out way before your sauce is properly reduced.\nFantastic with a side of steamed broccoli with a bit of the sauce drizzled over it.  YUM!!",

The chicken was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy, the 1/2 star I took off was because I found the recipe a bit too salty.  I'm sure this will probably vary depending on the brands of soy/fish sauce you use.  I would start light on both then add if needed.  I made half a recipe for my boyfriend and I with a side of sesame green beans and brown rice. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food as I only had 3 chicken thighs, but it was perfect, if not too much food.  I had no troubles with the liquid ratio, but I did have a big pan with not much meat (and a gas stove). I would tend to think that maybe the people who are having trouble may be overcrowding the pan.  All in all this is a wow-worthy recipe, definitely suitable for company. I'll be making this again!",

I have my Nonna's hand written recipe which was handed down from her Nonna. It is almost exactly ( my Nonna didn't use cayenne) this recipe but it is called Chicken Franchese. SO GREAT Like several of the other reviewers I too would cut back on the lemon and disregard the cayenne. Also keep your chicken stock handy in case the sauce gets too thick while heating. We always make extra sauce and serve it over pasta so every taste of the delicious sauce can be enjoyed. thank you FYI My Nonna was born in the Amalfi region of Italy (southern) where this recipe is a staple for all kinds of dishes i.e. mostly veggies like eggplant but also used for chicken veal and pork that's pounded into thin cutlets. The style of preparation is called \"indorato\" which translates to \"encased in gold\"",

        "reviewBody": "Hubs and I really enjoyed this Chicken French last night! Having said that let me say that I did make a few changes but nothing drastic. The amount of flour indicated in the recipe is a ridiculous amount! For two small chicken breast halves (about 5 oz. each) I used just 2 T. of flour and 1/4 t. of salt and pepper along with the pinch of cayenne and I still didn t use it all! I beat one egg and the milk in a pie plate dredged the chicken in the flour mixture and dunked it in the egg. I covered the pie plate with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator about an hour before dinner as Chef John mentions in the video. I browned the chicken for 4 minutes on a side over medium heat and removed it to a warm oven. For the sauce I had to use chicken broth but kept the other ingredients the same except the lemon juice which I cut way back using just 1 t. for my version. The sauce didn t thicken for me so I did add a little cornstarch/water just enough to give it some nice body and cling which really helped. The only thing I would change from my version next time would be to put the parsley in at the very end. It tended to darken after the chicken was added back in and reheated. Next time I will add the parsley after plating the chicken but before spooning the sauce over the top. All and all a great recipe and one we ll be making again! Thanks Chef John!",

        "reviewBody": "Another home run for chef John! The dish is excellent ( a bit too much lemon for my personal taste) but the technique is perfect. Unfortunately this site completely missed the mark as to the origin of this dish. It is a very traditional recipe from the old country. It's original name is chicken Francese. ( which translates to chicken French ) Tyler Florence also has a great version of this recipe I lived in Rochester for years and it is served in many restaurants. I have also eaten it in Italy and I have been in Dallas for about 35 years.... And it is served at every Italian restaurant too! Not sure why there is confusion about this being a dish created created in NY.",

It did turn out rather salty and I used coarse ground kosher salt - but it wasn't inedible salty. (and of course I expected it to be salty!) I prepared this in my infrared oven which I believe helped the skin to crisp very nicely. The whole thing was a beautiful uniform golden color. My husband teenage daughter and I loved the sauce but my young children didn't care for the lemon flavor of it so next time I will try making it with white wine in place of the lemon juice. This recipe is a keeper that I will make again and again.",

(Since my butternut squash was so large I doubled the recipe). Once done baking I removed the peel and started following the directions. My local grocery store was sold out of mascarpone so I used reg cream cheese. I highly recommend baking the squash as it makes for a great sauce (just like regular tomato sauce and spaghetti). The first time I served it I did it over whole wheat pasta the second time I used reg fettuccine - I will only use fettuccine for the recipe moving forward. I served with garlic toast and Cesar salad!",

Only difference, we cook the pasta in the same water the broccoli have been cooked in to give it extra flavor and stir fry some sun dried tomatoes and/or a few anchovies fillets with the garlic. We usually don't top it with parmesan but with roasted breadcrumbs.",

        "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe that I grew up eating and still make it often just last week as a matter of fact! I prefer to use Spaghetti Rigati or Thin Spaghetti. I usually just eyeball the recipe but Chef John's measurements are spot on. I do add some freshly ground black pepper and sometimes I change it up by adding caramelized onion. Last week I added the onion and also bacon that I chopped finely and crisped and sauteed the onion garlic and stems using a bit of the bacon grease along with the oil and butter. That was a tasty variation. Another variation that I have made one that might not appeal to everyone is to cook the florets until they are very soft and mashing the broccoli/garlic and onions into the stock leaving some of the broccoli in small chunks. This method makes it more of a sauce that will cling to the pasta. Alternately you can also set aside some florets to cook tender crisp so that you have the best of both worlds! For Chrissy yes you can use frozen broccoli but the cooking time will have to be adjusted. I would let the broccoli thaw first and then proceed with the recipe. Hope this helps!",

Since it's from Chef John, I'll try making it again before deleting it from my favorites, but may make a few adjustments to spice things up.",

We didn't miss it at all but next time may use more bell pepper to make up for this. Also subbed Heinz Chili Sauce for catsup as I prefer it to catsup. Also cut the sugar in half and next time may leave it out altogether. Added a bit of lemongrass for a more authentic flavor. Also added some red chili (the kind from a tube) as we like our food spicy. May add more red chili next time. And finally instead of using it as a garnish I added the chopped cilantro for the last two minutes of cooking and used a bit more than called for. It is a good starting recipe that can be fine-tuned to suit personal preferences. Thanks Chef John.",

I soak my chicken breasts beforehand in milk and marsala, about 1/2 cup wine  to 1 1/2 cups milk for 20 min. Then pat dry and I always use flour in a zip lock bag (the gallon sz) when pounding/flattening my chicken so it does not stick or fall apart. Then I use a couple of beaten eggs laced with a little more marsala before I dip into my flour seasoned flour mixture.  My chicken comes out so tender and juicy that you literally do not need a knife ever when eating my chicken.",

When she saw it, she said it looked beautiful, and after eating it raved about how much she loved it. Oh, and I loved it too. I might add whole heirloom carrots next time and experiment around with red potatoes or something just for fun, but still great just as it is.",

I don't know if Chef John intended using precooked or smoked types. The flavor from the sausage took this dish to decedent. And additional or various other veggies that work well roasted would make it even better. They're supposed to get a bit black (esp. sweet peppers) or brown and crisp. That's the goal. Then they're sweet and lovely. This dish is very easy short on time needed to preprep and really elegant. Great with crusty bread or a good green salad. Thanks John.",

You HAVE to use spicy sausage though sweet sausage doesn't give it that kick like the spicy does just cut them to 1-inch slices instead of two because wow it's spicy. Be generous with the salt but two teaspoons is a bit much. I kinda eyeballed it.

        "reviewBody": "Fantastic mix of flavors. And so easy. I did cut the spices in 1/2 (and only 1/8 tsp of Cayenne) but kept the 1 T of oil. I was nervous about the spiciness based on other reviews. I'm glad I did. It was plenty spicy and the blueberry sauce was a nice compliment to the spice. I used 3 chicken breasts (weigh 1.7 lbs total) and butterflied them. Let marinate in rub for about 3 hours. The trick I learned for the blueberry sauce is to use a big enough sauce pan so you have a very thin layer of sugar on bottom and it melts all at same time. If not I had part of my sugar getting very dark underneath and sugar on top not melted. After I added vinegar (I used red wine vinegar because it is what I had and it work splendidly) I had stirred but added the blueberries and let the small shell of hard sugar melt while the blueberries cooked. I didn't add salt or pepper to blueberries because I didn't think they need it. Family loved it. Thanks for sharing!",

I rubbed it in put the covered chicken in the fridge overnight then rubbed it off before cooking. It was spicy but had a great flavor. The blueberry sauce was overwhelmed by the apple cider vinegar. I left the mashed blueberries in the sauce because I couldn't bear to throw them out but there still wasn't a blueberry taste. I absolutely loved the concept of sweet and spicy but I think maybe lemon juice would be a better fit with the blueberries. The sauce definitely needs some tweaking.",

My final result had a subtle and valuable hint of dill but it is an after note and not at all overpowering. Having said that DO NOT SKIMP ON THE PICKLE JUICE! it really does add a layer of flavor that is lovely. The only significant change I made is the addition of perhaps 1/2 cup of white sugar (its all I had) to make it more like my favorite turkey brine. My method was to melt the sugar into a glass of very hot water and then stir that into the rest of the brine. Also I cut the salt in half because pickle juice is already salty and that's just how I roll baby! To be fair my result was tasty to me because I totally got a sweet ( not crazy- sweet) smoky and tangy coating on my grilled chicken and that is exactly what I was going for. Unlike most brining methods I use I only brined it for 3-4 hours or so. Therefore I did not rinse the brine off because I gambled that it would not be too salty and that worked! My remaining brine was boiled for 10. minutes. Then I removed about 1.5 cups of the magic potion and generously basted my bird every time i turned it over on the grill. The remaining brine got labled and frozen for next time it is too good to waste! By the way I grilled chicken wings and boneless skinless chicken breast. I had to be careful and keep turning it and watching it beca",

The breadcrumbs are really the star of this dish because they taste great (the cheese gives them a lot of flavor) and they add wonderful texture. I forgot to double the sauce recipe so there was only a little bit for each cutlet but it was still quite tasty and I'm sure it would be even better with the full amount.

The great thing is you can adjust the herbs according to your tastes. To cut costs I only used raisins and craisins (skipping the apricots and cherries). It still turned out fabulous!",

Added the celery and onion the dry herb mix (basil organo thyme sage) to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until everything was cooked through. Added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm.

        "reviewBody": "We loved this! Made it mostly as written. I used 6 boneless skinless thighs I had on hand & followed a couple of the suggestions I saw here. I used Sangiovese wine to deglaze the pan (plus some more for flavor) & a 28 oz. can of 'crushed tomatoes with basil' in place of sauce. The grocery store was out of green peppers so I used all red ones (sweeter anyway). It came out awesome! I served it over yellow saffron rice. DON'T TRY IT! Although I love both they don't \"play well together\". TOO MUCH! I'll save my yummy yellow rice for less flavorful dishes & serve my Cacciatore over pasta or white/brown rice. Take 2: Tried this again browning 2 S/B breasts seasoned with S&P Italian seasoning & 3 large cloves SLICED garlic (sweeter) in my smaller dutch oven. Removed breasts & deglazed pan with Cabernet Sovignon. Added: NO WATER; 2 4 oz cans of mushrooms drained (was out of fresh); 1 8 oz can of tomato sauce; 3 T. chicken broth; more Cabernet; LOTS of white onion & NO WATER. Put breasts back in dutch oven with LOTS of thin-sliced red yellow & orange mini-peppers on top. Cooked as instructed. Added halved grape tomatoes for the last 30 min. Served it over linguine with 'at-the-table' fresh-grated Parmesan. AWESOME! This goes on my 'Go-To' list! Thanks Chef John!!!",

I deglazed the pan using 1/2 cup white wine after I cooked the onions mushrooms garlic and spices.(instead of the water) 2. Then I added one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (instead of the tomato sauce) The end result was tender juicy chicken that falls off the bone in a rich and flavorful sauce that goes perfect over pasta.

Crispy crunchy flavorful yummy goodness. This is the BEST fried chicken I've ever made. (Makes me almost feel like a professional cook although far from it. Lol) And my kids absolutely LOVE this! (And I have a super picky eater on my hands) It's to die for with the Korean Fried Chicken Sauce but still equally as good without. I personally prefer it with the sauce as it's nice and spicy. And face it we could all use a little spice in our lives.:-) This will definitely be my go-to fried chicken recipe from now on. I know some people might think this is a bit time consuming to have to fry this in two steps but believe me when I say the effort is totally worth it!! I'd give this 10 stars if I could!!",

At first I was put off because the chicken once battered stuck to the bottom of the skillet but I figured out that I needed to turn it once intially after a few seconds and it came out great! I am making it for Easter dinner at my family's request! Watch the video it is very helpful. At first I thought it was just regular hard fried chicken but I was wrong. The flavors came together so well. Try it it will soon be a family fav.",

        "reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious!! I found that I only needed 2/3 of a cup of cold water I started out with 3/4 of a cup and my batter was too thin so I had to add some more flour and corn starch to it to thicken it up. We had 2 lbs of chicken and still had some batter left over. I'm thinking I'm going to use it tomorrow with some whole mushrooms since it has the onion and garlic flavor in it. I recommend you watch the video on Foodwishes.com before cooking because he gives some really neat tips that were very helpful. This chicken was moist and crunchy and fabulously tasty! The Korean Fried Chicken Sauce also listed on this site is VERY hot and we love spicy however 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes is a nice amount of heat. If you don't tolerate heat at all leave it out altogether do a taste test and add a tiny amount if you feel it needs a little heat. I made a double batch and only used 1/4 tsp. because my daughter doesn't tolerate spicy and it still had a little bite to it but she said it was tolerable. You can always add more red pepper flakes to individual servings for those who do want more heat so others can enjoy a less spicy sauce. I used half sweet chili sauce and half Sambal Oelek chili sauce (which is spicier than sweet chili sauce) in which both can be found in your local Asian Market. I also think it had too much lemon juice but he does say adjust to your taste. I had to add 2 tsp. of sugar to off set the tart. Next time I will start with 1/2 juiced lemon. Wonderful!",

        "reviewBody": "It's sometimes risky trusting internet recipes, but this is a definite winner. I subbed breast tenders for breasts, 2% for buttermilk, and garlic and onion powders for garlic and onion salts. Because I used tenders, I cut the brine ingredients in half and soaked the chicken for 30 min instead of 1 hr. I would suggest that you stay very conscious of the brine. Even though I cut my soaking time in half, my chicken ended up just a tad salty. Granted, I subbed the buttermilk and I didn't dry my chicken COMPLETELY post-brine. I'd say it's definitely safer to sub garlic and onion POWDERS for salts, and just keep salt at the table. At any rate this is a fantastic recipe on its own (and I imagine it makes a great template as well). Thanks, Chef John! Cheers!",

        "reviewBody": "Delicious! 5 stars! I made minor adjustments based on reading all the reviews. Because there was a consistent theme of \"too salty\", I reduced the kosher salt to somewhere between 1/4 c and 1/8 c. and used garlic and onion powders instead of salts. This worked perfectly. **Keep in mind the recipe calls for kosher salt, so if you use table salt (Morton's, etc), it will yield a saltier meal than if you use kosher salt so you might back-off a bit more** \nSo the breasts would cook thouroughly before burning the crust, I pounded the chicken to around 1\" thickness. I will make them thinner next time as the crust was pretty dark by the time the internal temp raised to 155F. (watched Chef John's video and he recommends this temp as the internal temp will continue to rise to around 165F after being removed from the oil - which it did). The taste was superb! Very flavorful and moist. I will definitely make these again. Served with Cowboy potatoes from this site and a Kale Salad. Great meal!",

        "reviewBody": "The whole purpose of brining is to help the white meat be more tender and flavorful.  Keep in mind that you discard the brine after the meat has marinated in it for an hour. Only a tiny bit is absorbed into the meat. The salt is what helps the meat hold it's moisture. If you marinate it more than an hour it will probably be saltier. IF you cut back on the salt there is no real need to brine it so don't bother. I made this exactly like the recipe called for and it was not salty at all.  It was delicious and moist.  I usually cut my chicken breast in half horizontally instead of pounding them.  Each breast is like less than an inch thick.  It makes cooking them easier and it helps cut the portion size down. Letting it sit for 5 minutes after cooking also helps the meat hold it's moisture. This is an awesome recipe. My family loved it, it was moist and very tasty.  I will be making it again.",

Everyone (boyfriend/fiance parents and little sister) polished it off before anyone had time to get seconds. The only thing I will criticize is that it was indeed a little salty but I used onion powder instead of onion salt. Regardless this was VERY good and went well with the carrots and dinner rolls we had with it. I will most definately make this again.:D",

        "reviewBody": "This was delicious. I wanted a lower fat version so I used 2 1/2 lbs of Chicken Tenders instead of the whole chicken. I did not give up the sour cream yet by using skinless breasts it did eliminate a good bit of the fat calories and this dish was still amazing. I used roasted jarred red peppers. I added the cilantro toward the end so that the fresh flavor was not cooked out of it. I did not add the sour cream until I had taken the chicken out of the broth at the very end just before serving. I could see that the broth was very thin and I desired it thicker so I mixed 1/4c of Wondra flour into the sour cream making sure that the flour and sour cream were well mixed before I added it....did not want any flour lumps. I then added the mixture to the broth at a low temp and mixed until it thickened. It came out beautifully thickened and the sour cream sauce stayed perfect. Be patient with the thickening at the lower temperature....you do NOT want to boil the sour cream or it will separate.",

Broiling worked well I used Reynold's non stick foil (love that stuff) but I think actually grilling the chicken would have been even better. Chicken thighs are pretty thin and cook really fast. I didn't get the 'finish' I would have liked using the broiler. Grilling over direct heat and glazing the entire time would have been easier and produced a better glazed finish to the chicken without over cooking it.",

I had Hillshire Farms Cheddarwurst on hand and substituted it for the linguica. I used one large jalapeno pepper and took the others reviewers suggestion and doubled the orzo and the flavors were amazing. Came out so good even my picky eater cleaned his plate. Smelled so good while it was cooking as well! Thanks Chef John for an amazing recipe!",

Browning the chicken is a must because you get those great flavors left in the pan. I didn't have a bay leaf but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. If I was to make any change at all it would only be to pare back the amount of meat or increase the orzo. Thank you for this great recipe this one is definitely a keeper!",

As my husband does not like spicy food I did not use spicy peppers and adjusted by using green and red bell peppers. I also used two whole chicken legs instead of that many thighs and chorizo for the sausage. I decreased the overall amount of meat and used a little more onion and peppers. The risotto technique is not necessary to achieve the same flavour results as you can also just toss in more of the broth in one go. I would recommend letting it sit there when almost done for at least 5-10 minutes. We prefer this dish the day after because the flavours have more time to infuse. Also doubles for a nice cold salad.",

Wasn't sure which paprika to use so used 1/2 hot 1/2 smoked. Didn't have orzo either used risotto. Now it seems I shouldn't even be rating this recipe since I didn't really make IT! Sorry...but the seasonings are what really made the dish and they are great. I liked having a lot of meat in it but I'm only feeding 2 - more pasta/rice is a definite budget stretcher. I will make this again and try orzo then. Thanks again Chef! I love your videos & recipes!",

    "description": "When it comes to mustard, sweet-hot works amazingly well, especially as a glaze for chicken. Even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, I'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken. By the time this is done, it doesn't have a super-strong mustard flavor. It gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices. The old saying 'The closer the bone, the sweeter the meat' really is true. Leaving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness.",

I believe the key to not having burnt onions it to bake this in a dish, and not on a baking pan, and being sure to place the onions UNDER the chicken. I put a heavy layer of onions on the bottom (I think I used almost 3 onions.) Drizzled them with a little olive oil & seasoned with salt & pepper before continuing. Then after everything was in the frying pans, I filled in the spaces between the chicken with cut up red potatoes. Baked, covered, at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes then removed the foil and baked a few minutes longer to get that golden color. It was delicious.",

Trouble is cooking time should be adjusted. Boneless cook faster than bone-in. I took the thighs out earlier than what the recipe called for (could tell they were done) but they were still a bit dry. I was also expecting more flavor 'pop' with the ingredients of the marinade. Might give it another whirl with bone-in.",

I think that next time, and there will be a next time,  that I would  reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter.  With all the fat that's in this recipe, it turns a very healthy side dish into one that's high in calories and fats.",

I don't have an oven safe skillet so made this in a dutch oven. I used chicken breast (thought I had thighs in the freezer but no) which was fine but I think thighs would be best. I also used breakfast sausage instead of smoked because I prefer the flavor. I also used dried rosemary and thyme (1/2 tsp. each which was plenty). I was worried that I had added to much chicken broth but if you follow all the steps by the end it thickens up so nicely (you'll see if you watch the video). I served this with a green salad with apples and dried cranberries. Thanks Chef John! Another winner!",

I then added my cut up chicken breast (I forgot to rub in the seasoning first). I evenly sprinkeld the seasoning mix over the chicken added minced garlic and let it cook. After the chicken was mostly cooked through I added a can of diced tomatoes sprinkled the ginger olive oil and garlic powder over the tomatoes added hot diced green chilis and mixed it all into the chicken. I let it simmer for about 10 minutes added the coconut milk and let simmer another 5 minutes. I served it over Basmati rice. Next time I will add diced potatoes to the dish.",

I made some changes because we're a family on a budget; we bought a whole chicken cut it into pieces and removed the skin rubbed with the spice mixture (I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp since we have small children) and then baked the chicken at 375 degrees for 40 minutes covered with aluminum foil. For the sauce we just used one jalapeno and we used half a can of (drained) diced tomatoes since it was mid-winter and the tomatoes in the store looked unripe. This recipe was so fantastic even our toddler was gobbling up the chicken as fast as we could hand him pieces! I feel like inviting people over for dinner now just so I can serve them this recipe LOL.",

It was a little bland but I just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great! And you can't beat it for healthy. For my husband I stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto (you could use ham too) into his and he loved it. I also doubled the potato as per previous reviews here and I loved the thick texture. I will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks Lon!",

I used fresh broccoli two small red potatoes with the skins on and omitted the nutmeg (had none in the house). I also threw some reduced-fat white cheddar cheese in the bowl and it got all melty and delicious and tasted as good as the Panera broccoli cheddar I love but can no longer eat because it's awful for you. But even with the cheese this recipe is low-cal. Fabulous!",

As far as I am concerned if you can mess up the recipe and it still turns out well it's a keeper:) Used veggie broth instead of chicken and fresh broccoli. Loved it!",

I also added 1/4 cup of half and half at the end just to make it a little creamier.

Also try adding chopped potato skins (it has all the nutrients) to the soup to make it chunkier or add milk continuously to thin it out.

I also used 8 oz. fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese (3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor) for the shredded cheddar......just as good and maybe better!!",

I used a cast iron skillet instead of a stainless steel skillet and it reduced the time of caramelizing the mushrooms in half. I m a seasoned cook and I always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus. I watched Chef John s video of this recipe and I think that I saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video. Chef John always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and I d bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning.:) I served this with Sarah s Rice Pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2nd side dish.

The only changes I made were I used a whole pound of bacon (it was just easier) I used regular tomatoes (both yellow and red) because I didn't have any cherry ones and I ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store didn't have arugula - I could have used fresh spinach I guess. I also made Chef John's creme fraiche ahead of time (although I could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site.) The creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish. I would not substitue it for anything since I've already done it this way! The creme fraiche didn't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness. I should have taken a picture because the yellow and red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish. My teenagers also loved this and I know my husband would have but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone. Poor guy. I didn't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though. This dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always!",

As is my custom I went through the comments looking for suggestions and found a few. Crème fraiche became sour cream. Ditalini pasta became Fred Mayer s small stuff that was on sale two weeks ago. Argula became spinach. Maybe argula is finer chopped than spinach but four cups of chopped spinach just about overflowed my 12 inch by 1 inch iron skillet. Next time I ll cut back to three cups. I found a way to cut down on the mess from chopping spinach while at the same time getting it done faster and doing a better job. Having not ever seen a recipe requiring whole spinach leaves I just chopped up the whole plastic container of Freddy s baby spinach leaves using the scissor-like multi-bladed chopping tool that the boss cook bought on one of her Pampered Chef forays.",

I tweaked the recipe each time and this is my recommendations:\n1. use 1 can of coconut milk, not 2. Using 2 totally dilutes the flavors. \n2. I add 2 kafir lime leaves, for an authentic Thai flavor. \n3. Instead of straining the broth, I use a large infuser ball and keep the garlic, ginger, lime leaves and lemon grass inside,and keep it in the finished soup product so the soup gets as much kick as possible. \n4. For a one pot cooking method, I sautee mushrooms in the oil, add fish sauce, and then add the broth/infuser ball (with garlic, ginger, lemon grass and lime leaves). After adding the broth, I added an entire boneless chicken leg/thigh and let it cook in the broth. After chicken is cooked, I removed it, shredded it and added it back to the pot. Then I added 1 can of coconut milk, curry paste, lime juice. Finish by garnishing with red onions, cilantro, jalapeno slices and lime wedge garnish.",

There is something missing from the recipe in step #5 it says to add the lime juice but nowhere in the ingredients is lime juice listed other then the limes for garnishment. I used 2 tablespoons because I found another thai recipe similiar to this one and that's what it called for. Other then that I followed this recipe to a T and it was wonderful. Although next time I would like a little more heat and will use serrano peppers instead of jalapenos. Also this is a light soup recipe and if your looking to make it more hearty try using basmati rice or glass noodle with it. They are both great. Thanks for sharing will be using this often.",

I went to 3 stores before finding the red curry paste and it really didn't add much spice. I would substitute ground red pepper and use a lot of it as the coconut milk neutralizes spice. I used 3 chicken breasts and added 2 fresh tomatoes sliced at the end of the cooking. The fresh limes and fresh cilantro are an absolute must. Oh yeah the fish sauce is disgusting so just use a little salt. Serve with jasmine rice or rice noodles. This soup is every bit as good as what I have had in restaurants in Hawaii Key West and Miami. The first time I tried it I reported to my mom that I just had the most awakening soup that tasted of chicken lime and milk. Bizarre but it totally works.",

They both said it tasted \"restaurant worthy\". I am not an experienced chef so I like recipes that aren't too complicated. This recipe is not complicated but I do recommend watching the video as I found it very helpful to watch the steps being performed. The grocery store I went to didn't have fresh lemon grass so I bought the minced lemon grass that is sold in a tube. One tube equals 6 lemon grass stalks so I squeezed half of the tube into the chicken broth. It was perfect and I doubt I'll use fresh lemon stalk in the future. Also I used 3/4 teaspoon red curry paste and the soup was not spicy at all. When I cook it just for me and my husband I will kick it up a notch. Thank you for sharing such an awesome recipe! Love it and will be making this from here on out.",

I made this soup last Sunday and will make it many times again in the future. The only thing I changed was adding twice the red chili paste like other reviewers sliced shiitake mushrooms more broth and cooked longer because I wanted the red onions softer. It was a challenge trimming the fat off the chicken thighs but worth the flavor and moistness breasts do not give. I appreciated Chef John's tip straining out the ginger lemon grass garlic cooking in chunks and using the lite and regular coconut milk. I served it with 1/4 cup basmati rice. This was so tasty it was gone in two days. I am making Chef John's gumbo today. Go Colts!!!!",

It's a definite keeper for us. 3 of us ate it all up it was so delicious with a little bit left for hubby's lunch tomorrow. Follow Chef John's video. I just have to add to my review: we have made this several times since my last rating and I LOVE this stuff!! I follow the video exactly for cutting it and putting it in cold water to stop the cooking. I do cut the oil though because it would be way too oily if we did not. When I make it now I have to make extra we love it so much. I have never been a fan of broccoli in the past and do not really care for it raw. But I have become a fan of broccoli because of this recipe. It is simple to make and the red pepper flakes give it a nice appearance and pizzazz if making it for company.",

I TRIPLED the recipe and there was not one bit of leftovers. However I used sharp cheddar rather than Gruyere (a Vermonters spin on it) and instead of doing individual sandwiches I hollowed out a big loaf of artisan bread and stuffed it with the cheese sauce. We cut it into sections and had it with a side of steamed broccoli in a sharp cheddar cheese sauce. Absolutely amazing. I will definitely make this dish a regular one. It's affordable it's quick and it's delicious.",

My kitchen is almost bare but I had chicken breasts and my husband loves chicken cordon bleu so I decided to try and cobble something together. Hubby gave it a \"very good\" so I thought I'd share! I followed the directions for the most part but I only had Buddig ham sandwich meat and some Irish cheddar or something (the wrapper is gone so I'm not sure. It was just a very sharp cheese!). I doubled the recipe and used panko bread crumbs with the butter as a base in a 7x11 glass pan chopped chicken next and then my crazy ham & cheese mixture. As I said I followed the directions but didn't have Dijon so I mixed some yellow mustard with a bit of dry mustard. I poured/spooned the mix over the chicken and topped it off with another layer of panko and in the oven it went! I like it fairly well myself but I have a low spice tolerance so I'd probably do a little less mustard next time and I admittedly went a little crazy with the panko XD but overall it's a success more than just edible and I definitely want to have it with french bread and \"real\" ham sometime!!!",

I used 6\" French Rolls from the bakery and doubled the recipe to make 8 open faced sandwiches. My Husband says \"These are great! 5 stars!\" I did use the Gruyere cheese which I have never bought before. Both of my sons were holding their shirts over their noses saying they stink, so I was afraid they wouldn't eat them at all. Well...One son ate 3, the other ate 2. My husband had 2 and then came back in the kitchen and snagged the last one before I got the chance to taste it! I never even got to take a picture of them they were gone so fast! Since Gruyere is so expensive, and according to my 16 y/o smells like stinky feet, I may just use Swiss next time.  I'll have to set one to the side for myself next time before calling in the hoards. According to the guys' reactions, there will definitely be a next time. Keep 'em comin' Chef John, you've saved dinner more than once at our place.",

I doubled the flour and found it was still runny at the required cooking time. My crust was pale and no bubbling in the pie. I cooked it 15 minutes longer (55 minutes) realizing the temperature has to be hot enough and LONG enough to make the 'thickener' work properly. At the end of 55 minutes my crust was golden and the pie was bubbling all over. I removed it and let it cool about two hours. It was thickened to perfection. Another thing that might have helped was adding the tomatoes to the flour/sugar mixture in a large bowl and stirring to coat the tomatoes. My husband and I were happy with the flavor even though there were a few strings coming off 'my' tomatoes in my pie.",

In that mindset I tried this pie and I have to say it's good. A little odd but good. One wouldn't think it's apple but it's quite nice. I used tomatoes with a bit of a blush to them and I had to increase the baking time dramatically for the crust to brown. I would also decrease the spices next time-- the cinnamon in particular is a little too much. But it's quite a nice use for those before-the-frost tomatoes! I'll be making this again next year.",

I used it in the \"Baked Lemon Chicken with Mushroom Sauce\" recipe from this site as well (thanks for the suggestion Naples34102!). It went fantastic in that recipe. I think it would also be great just to rub some chicken breasts with the seasoning and sautee them in some olive oil - add some sides and you've got a great meal!",

        "reviewBody": "I read the reviews and I have to disagree. I know this is Chef John but this was a huge disappointment. I followed this recipe to the letter and what I ended up with tasted like meat and potatoes boiled with cabbage and water. I expected some apple flavor using the apple chicken sausage and cooking it in apple juice. The apple flavor was nonexistent and the sausage was tough (the texture really changed) burst open (not good for presentation) and I did simmer on a low temperature. It was so bland that near the end I added some caraway seeds more salt and pepper and we actually used cider vinegar at the table to add some flavor. If I were to make this again I would use more onion and add fresh apples to the cabbage. Since the sausages picked up no flavor from the apple juice and were totally cooked anyway I'd most likely not simmer them with the cabbage and just add in toward the end to reheat (they looked great after browning). Sorry Chef John this is just my opinion but I did not consider this one of your best efforts. Doubtful I'll make again too many tweaks to make this work for us.",

It was easy to cut shreds of cabbage from the head and it tasted great much better than a similar recipe using sauerkraut. After reading other reviews it seems some have misread the recipe using apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider. Yikes no wonder they did not like the strong vinegar taste. There is no vinegar called for in this recipe. I recommend they try it again but with apple cider this time and believe they will really enjoy it!",

The sausage tasted fine and the cabbage cooked in apple juice was different. If you know someone who doesn't like cabbage they might be OK with this because it really doesn't have a cabbage flavor just a sweet flavor yet not apple-y. However the Yukon Golds cooked in apple juice didn't make the cut. I want potatoes to taste like potatoes and I found the sweet flavor imparted by the apple juice to be unsettling. I probably won't make this recipe again. This review isn't a \"Dear John\" letter but it isn't a love letter either.",

I also did not puree the broccoli.  I like a chunky soup.  For the roux I melted the butter and removed from heat.  Then I measured the 3 Tbs. flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smooth.  Then I added it to the melted butter.  Then added that to the soup.  NO LUMPS!  Served with Grated Cheddar Cheese and Warm French Bread.  So good on a Hurricane Wilma night.",

Rather than puree I followed another member's suggestion and just let the broth and broccoli boil down but after 10 minutes I took some of the broccoli out so we could have some big pieces of it in the soup. I doubled the broth because it does boil off quite a bit. What a keeper- this is my new broccoli soup thanks!!

Only difference I made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream (since I had it on hand), rather than 2 cups 2%.  Also, I didn't have the full amount of cheddar, so I threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference.  But I almost never have velveeta, and would recommend sticking with the cheddar just out of principle's sake.  I used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream (just a preference).  Then I added the milk and cream at the end with the cheese.  It was definitely a delicious and thick soup, just like Panera's.  Yum! Thanks a bunch, gildawen!",

It was bland and seemed to be lacking something.   I’m thinking it’s the cooking process.  It seems backwards.  Typically, milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling, especially if simmered for a long period of time.  It works out o.k. for this recipe because it’s so thick from the cheese that you don’t really notice.   What I found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock, absent of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind.  It’s only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender.   Onions, celery, and carrots are essential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor.  I would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more cook time.  The other change I would make is when to add the milk.  I would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk, but that’s just me.",

        "reviewBody": "Three stars because it actually tasted good, but the whole cooking process was just strange. In all my years of cooking, I have never seen instructions like that. All you really gotta do is brown your butter, add the other veggies along with the broth, simmer til the vegetables are done. Then add your thickener - in this case, flour and melted butter. Then you add the milk and the cheese. It turned out great this way, and only took me and my daughter about a half hour to make it. Simmering the already thickened broth/milk for 20 minutes? Then adding the vegetables and cooking them for another 20 minutes? Seems to me that the recipe instructions are actually written in reverse!",

        "reviewBody": "I made this soup and my husband (who is not a really big soup fan) could not get enough of it.  Only difference I made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream (since I had it on hand), rather than 2 cups 2%.  Also, I didn't have the full amount of cheddar, so I threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference.  But I almost never have velveeta, and would recommend sticking with the cheddar just out of principle's sake.  I used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream (just a preference).  Then I added the milk and cream at the end with the cheese.  It was definitely a delicious and thick soup, just like Panera's.  Yum! Thanks a bunch, gildawen!",

I was so disappointed that I didn't care how close it was to Panera's recipe -- I just wanted flavor! I ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base (2 chicken bouillon cubes would work too) and this did the trick! We ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner and I will make this regularly throughout the winter WITH my additions. Good luck!",

I used the exact measurements and ingredients listed except celery, the only other difference I made was instead of simmering the milk/flour/butter to thicken I used chicken broth as the liquid, let it simmer a little (around 7 minutes) added all my veggies and 1/2 cup of water (my burners are too strong and I feared all the liquid evaporating and becoming a pudding instead of a soup) and let it simmer until veggies were tender. Last step I added milk, cheese and served. WOW. BIG HIT with me and my husband who doesn't like soup. The flavor was all there, just be careful with adding salt as most chicken stocks already have sodium and cheese adds a lot.",

        "reviewBody": "As the submitter said it's open to what you like to make your changes to fit your taste. I found two copycat Panera bread broccoli-cheese soup recipes - here & food.com. They are very very very similar. Food.com adds nutmeg. I like the almost invisible taste of nutmeg in creamy soups. I am not a nutmeg fan (always halve it in baked goods) but in this soup: Mmmm! I changed the directions because they seemed really odd/off the order of things. This one says 1 1/2c broccoli; the other 1/2#. 'Pretty sure the answer is in between those two. I went with close to 1/2#. Daughter said it had too much broccoli or not enough cheese - didn't know which.:) Anywayyyy I microsteamed it three minutes then allowed to cool. I sauteed 2 medium sized cut-bigger-than-matchstick carrots in 1/4c butter 5 minutes; then added 1 pc celery diced sauteed 2 minutes; then about half cup onion (half onion) five minutes. 'Meant to do the sprinkling of 1/4c flour next but got ancy & added 2c homemade chicken broth next. Put that in a blender (daughter request) along with the broccoli then back in the pot & thickened once it got hot. After thickening added 1/4t salt & nutmeg; & 1/8t black pepper; 1c 2% milk; 1c half&half.(Probably go for all half&half next time or more thickener with milk). I chopped up an 8oz block Kraft sharp cheddar but it wasn't sharp enough enough cheese or both. Simmered 15 minutes. Good soup.:)",

Later, he said \"why don't we just go eat them at my moms?\"  Clearly - mom had some good stuffed peppers.\n\nLast night I took a stab at making Stuffed Peppers for the first time ever, for my boyfriend, and used this recipe.  I halved the recipe, and halved 2 large peppers and filled them that way, to make for easier leftover servings.  As I prepared them, my boyfriend stood over me, smirking... and said \"your way is a little different.\"  I could see he was skeptical!!\n\nPresentation wise, these peppers looked the part.  Beautiful.  We sat and ate, and for the first few minutes, didn't speak.  I was getting nervous... I don't think he likes them.  Half way through my plate, he quietly says \"These aren't like my moms.\"  I said \"sorry babe...\" and before I could finish he exclaimed \"THEY\"RE BETTER!!!!  THEY ARE SO FREAKIN GOOD!\"   And they were!!  As I sit here writing my first review, I'm eating the leftovers.  YUM!!\n\nThe only thing, and this may be because I eyeballed halving the recipe, is I wish I made more sauce.  It was delicious and we poured some on extra rice on the side, but there wasn't a lot left for the leftovers.  It was so delicious I'd want extra sauce to pour ridiculous amounts of!  YUM!!  May be different if you do the full recipe, or maybe worth doubling the sauce, or 1 and a half.",

I followed the recipe pretty well though I did use less of the cheese as I didn't feel like opening another bag. It got rave reviews from everyone. I loved it my husband loved it and the kids loved it. The green peppers and bright red sauce make for pretty contrast and the savory flavor is wonderful. We had quite a lot left over and the leftovers taste just as good. I would highly recommend making a huge batch and freezing some. It's cheaper and tastes better than the boxed frozen stuffed peppers.",

        "reviewBody": "Probably the best peppers I have EVER eaten! They were fantastic! I did change it up just a bit because of what I had on hand. I had a 2 pound package of 93% fat free ground beef so I skipped the sausage. To mock a spicy sausage flavor I added some fennel seed pepper flakes and ground sage to the meat. I used brown rice instead of white rice. For the diced tomatoes I used rotel style tomatoes and drained them. I didn't have any parmesan cheese so what was I going to do? Light bulb moment... those pizza parmesan packets they give you when you order pizza! I have a ton of them so I added about 12 packets of that to the meat. I didn't add the cheese on top until the last 20 minutes and I ended up using mozzarella on top. Served it with some whole grain spaghetti that was tossed with onion garlic and pepper. TOTALLY delish! I am SO full and I am fighting the urge to go munch on more... the sauce was great too!",

        "reviewBody": "I made half of the filling mixture for this recipe and it was plenty for three smallish green peppers (6 halves). I prepared these early in the day covered and refrigerated them. I omitted the pork sausage and used fresh tomatoes. The recipe is confusing because it instructs you to stir the rice and parmesan into the meat mixture. Then later instructs you to sprinkle the remaining parmesan (what remaining parmesan?) over the top. So not knowing how much to put where I just winged it and used 2 T. in the meat mixture and sprinkled more on top after baking. I baked these covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15 more minutes and my peppers were still crisp tender. I wouldn t have wanted to bake them any longer. This was good and the hint of balsamic vinegar was a nice addition.",

Confusion over when to add the cheese, in the mixture or as a topping, or 1/2 and 1/2.  I added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there.  It would've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a LOT of stuffing, so much I piled it as high as I could on each pepper.  Not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me, but I think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given.  Spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier.  If you think is good the first night, it's double WOW reheated the next day.",

The only complaint I have about the recipe is that made as is, you have way too much filling or not enough peppers.  I used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over.  I even over over stuffed mine and had extra.  I could have easily stuffed 3-4 more peppers with the filling.  I just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce.  Thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper!",

As with most cream pastas the thickening takes place when you remove it from the heat and set it aside for 5 minutes or so. I served this meal with caeser salad and garlic bread. I will be making this again for sure. I loved making that fresh pesto and this dish will definetly need salt. I added three teaspoons and then put the salt on the table for everyone else to add to it if they wanted to. Even after 3 teaspoons it needed more. The flavor comes alive once you put the salt in it will seem bland without it.",

I followed the recipe except I used a heaping teaspoon of chicken base paste (like bouillon from Sam's) instead of broth or water. I then added sauteed mushrooms at the end (after tasting) and I really loved the addition. I don't know how thick the sauce is supposed to be but it was a bit thin easily swiped up with crusty bread. I'd bet slightly underdoing the pasta and then cooking it a while in the sauce would thicken it by soaking into the pasta. Last but not least I had to use a big pot NOT a skillet. I'm surprised no one else commented on this. Anyway YUM!!",

In addition I'll probably add a few more pine nuts at the end because I like the flavor and the crunch. Like others noted it says it will feed 6 but the truth is it will feed them not only dinner but lunch as well!:) The one thing that surprised me was that I was using a super larger skillet and by the time I got to the last step there wasn't enough room. I had to dump it all in the large pot I had used to cook the pasta. So keep that in mind if you make the 6-serving recipe. The leftovers were great for lunch the next several days. I'm recommending this recipe to all the cooks I know.",

Cruising on a sailboat we need to cook with what we have; no running down to the store for ingredients. Didn t have pine nuts onboard so made this. To save time/propane I skipped blanching the basil. Will definitely be making this again!",

I also added chicken breast just coated in a little flour lemon pepper and lemon juice and grilled on a skillet. Chopped the chicken and added to the pasta. Really simple recipe with really great taste.",
